added 4 samples:

1. Use naive embedding to do review socre regression

2. Use pre_trained Glove embedding

3. Use LSTM and pre_trained embedding

4. Build language model

Data Preparsion:

run pre_process_tokenlize to tokenlize text

run view_data to create train and eval datasets.

padded text sequence to get data for language model
