"studio is minutes stroll from here . that means we are regulars . we also visit numerous other locations for sustenance and refreshment ! said , this has become the firm food is great . chips are exceptionally addictive . fishcake & combo is beers are varied and many . well kept and flowing fresh lemonade on the bar and one of the most expertly crafted ’ s around ( without going over the top with sherry and basil leaves ) gets loud inside from in the surrounding offices . often calms swiftly before and staff are — very helpful and want a pub for a bit more of dinner than drinks ? upstairs and you have a dedicated dining room at the top of a spiral staircase . 's in all what a pub should be . . . by regulars and newbies alike . good food and seating outside , but plenty of people standing around in groups chatting and laughing over a good drink .

"and bland fish and chips that in no way compare to other local establishments . would give the restaurant an average , but it 's hard to justify for just okay fish . the price is this high due to the bottomless chips but are bottomless chips really necessary ? beer selection and boring interior . smelled like fried fish when left . was fine and the food arrived in a reasonable timeframe . , there are just too many better options out there . or the .",2.0

"few away from square , found this restaurant by menu with a dark decor , bistrot style , small tables for , average service , well priced and % discount added to the bill for service charge , something common in had a charcuterie board as a starter , good selection with a fresh crisp salad , priced well at . main opted for a , cooked as per order . the meat is not amongst the best had , it is a good cut . asked the waiter for some bread , waited for minutes , waiter vanished so continued eating they forgot me , the bread never came , something that should have came as soon as asked for , since the plates were already delivered on the table . also took some minutes to ca n't say that this place is not good since the food quality is above average and well priced , however do expect a better service .",3.0

"is a traditional pub with an upstairs dining was fairly busy and the atmosphere was relaxed . menu was varied , with a small selection of starters and a wider variety of mains including a chicken roast . ordered starters to share amongst people and none of them mains were superb . and pie was one of the best 've ever had , and the portions were generous . vegetables were particularly good , something often find wanting in a pub lunch , but not here , and no doubt helped by having next staff were friendly and attentive and the meal was reasonably priced .

"steaks were amazing and how the menu is explained is interesting . you 're not a steak fan then be prepared for a more limited menu but if you are a steak fan , you wo n't be disappointed . we were eating at peak time on a evening it 's not surprising it was busy , the service started off very efficient but things did slow down as they got busier . risk of sounding old , it 's quite dark and very loud in there so not overly romantic but there 's definitely a good atmosphere . food is quite expensive although it is worth it , it 's more of an occasional thing though rather than somewhere 'd go regularly .",4.0
"me start by saying the prices are ridiculous anyway . for a main course of veal schnitzel is not appropriate outside of a michelin starred restaurant ( as good as the schnitzel was , and it was really good ) . the worst thing was , when we asked for chips instead of new potatoes with our schnitzel they gave us two chips . . think for a main that really takes the dessert was good ( had the mousse ) but a little odd tasting ( it came with pretzels which did n't really go ) and the service was ok , if not outstanding . waitress was pleasant but there was a wait for our desserts , and at times we had to work to catch waiting staff 's attention . they were not really deserving of the full % added service charge . 'd go again , but only to the bar area downstairs which for some reason is cheaper ( but still not exactly cheap ) . only if there were n't other better options available nearby .",3.0

"arrived at about on a for some lunch before an afternoon tour we had booked . this time we got a table on the main floor but those arriving at or after had to go barmaid was really friendly . ordered two different burgers - mine said the salad and pickle ' on the menu so asked her whether that meant ( as suspected ) that it came without these things . said not and that it was just the menu being a bit quirky , so ordered it it came without ! my boyfriends came with them and he does n't like them , so got them anyway in the end ! food was delicious and reasonably priced for central ( burger and fries around the mark ) atmosphere was relaxed , service good ( apart from small pickle issue ! ) and would highly recommend it . change from the chains .",4.0

"was our first time in , and wanted to make the most of it by hitting some cool spots . being extremely disappointed with 's we were n't sure what to expect from entering , we were both blown away by the dining room . husband started with the crab salad and had the lamb breast – both outstanding . server ( believe his name was ) recommended the pork chop ( cooked perfectly with a nice bit of char ) and the sea bass ( also cooked perfectly with a nice crisp skin but the accompanying sauce was bit on the sweet side ) . were thoroughly satisfied with our meal but were too full for dessert so we asked if we could move to the bar for some cocktails . was very accommodating and had us seated right away . even came by later on to make sure were enjoying ourselves . husband and are always in search of a good cocktail . had just gone to & and the , both known for their cocktails . can honestly say is on par with both of those establishments . drinks were great ! each had three cocktails from the bar menu and would have stayed for more if we didn ’ t have a flight to to catch the next dining experience was a great way to cap off a first time visit to an amazing city ! were a local , would definitely be a regular at . will definitely be back one day ! !",5.0

that this restaurant was associated with another in only afterward but is probably even better than its sister version because it is or appears to be new . all had different pizzas with one of us having grilled fish and all meals were eaten with pleasure since each was well presented and cooked . staff makes for a pleasant experience and of course being able to see the chefs working away and appearing to enjoy being there shows that there is a decent spirit in the place and this is reflected in the reasonable price also for what we had and will go again,4.0

lovely meal sitting outside in the sun with lots going on . service even though they were very busy . think that the pizze served at are the best outside of and especially the romana pesto pomodoro with my own extra topping of gorgonzola . made even better as the meal was paid for using of vouchers which with turned into of tokens . only slight downside to sitting outside was a slight smell of drains,5.0

"have long been a fan of the afternoon tea and this is an opportunity for restaurants to shine offering small bite size scones with finger sandwiches and buckets of tea to wash it do so many restaurants get it wrong ? is a fab location and should be packed out for afternoon tea , it was not , there was just one other table . we were told to sit where we liked and we did not see anyone again until they brought the tea ? they had might have ordered a glass of was just choices of sandwich ham & mustard or ( no vegetarian option was offered ) scones and cakes were all shop bought and the scones were far to big for afternoon tea . there was a defrosted mini eclair and millionaire shortbread plus a huge slice of sandwich which also appeared shop was a very average day and like something a bit special for afternoon tea .",3.0

"is a place one should not miss while visiting . a delightful shopping and discovery tour , the restaurant is suitably located to have your meal . may have to queue a minute during peak hours , but it is worthwhile . garlic mushroom is commendable and beans on toast or “ posh beans ” as on the menu - if remember correctly - cater for those who like spicy food ! son enjoyed his cloudy lemonade . draught beer had a different aftertaste unlike what am familiar with . an enjoyable experience , reasonably priced , tasty food , prompt and friendly service which made us return the following day even managed to get the same table ! !",4.0

"my partner went with friends on the opening week , she recommended that we go one evening to unwind after work . atmosphere was wonderful , and the service was excellent . was explained to us , from the concept of the food , to the tailored cocktails and the ethos behind the style of the restaurant . food was exemplary ; the yogurt puri were a delight - so much so we ordered another helping , and the puffed rice was inviting , fresh , and with the perfect mix of flavour and heat . a stand out was the chilli paneer , and the kati roll ; both of which would happily eat again , and attempted to steal from my partner 's plate ! of note were the selection of drinks ( though being a school night , we stuck to and shared a cocktail ) - the fact that the cocktail was clearly made with an on the spot sugar water mix , rather than a pre-made glucose `` simply syrup '' speaks volumes ; they care deeply about the food , the drink , and the experience , and seem to want to serve the food that you 'd want to make for yourself - there 's no . one of the best meals 've eaten this year , and we 're taking friends from out of town tonight for another round !",5.0

lunch today with a friend . both had a salad with a bottle of sparkling water . well presented and very tasty . followed the salad with some lovely chocolate cake and a custard tart between us . seemed too good an opportunity to miss . bill was reasonable seeing that we were near . service was excellent . only slightly odd thing was having to leave the building to go down a flight of steps to find the toilets .,5.0
for a quick and unsophisticated meal at a very good price . advantage of the meal deal of two courses for just over and thoroughly enjoyed quality of the food and service is inconsistent and depends greatly on how busy they are . said that if you are unsatisfied tell the staff and they will endeavour to sort out the issues quickly .,3.0
"place is a real find . visited night for dinner , and the staff are just fantastic - super friendly and really helpful . asked at the last minute whether we could sit in the downstairs bar rather than the upstairs restaurant . acquaintance had said the restaurant part could sometimes be a bit empty and lacking in atmosphere . had put a note against our booking and offered us a table downstairs , although we then ended up eating upstairs as it was really busy ! was too much trouble . lovely waiters were very knowledgeable , which is not a given at many places . was delicious , the wine was excellent and a good selection of reasonably priced bottles available . had a fantastic time and will certainly be back .",5.0

went to for our office lunch . service was really slow and it took us over hours to have our meal . waited over minutes for our dessert and watched a waiter serve and be attentive to every table around us but we were ignored . were going to order more cocktails but gave up due to this . only good thing was that a waitress recognised we 'd waited too long for dessert and took the bottles of wine we 'd had off our bill !,2.0

here for breakfast on an unseasonably cold morning . the unlimited coffee and price tag looked inviting the food was just ok and the place too busy for the four of us to be served together and coffee refills came but very slowly . staff were very pleasant and hard working but the place is just a little too tight for them to move around easily .,3.0

"on board at the end of , a beautiful , warm sunny bank holiday , and we visited with a pre-booked wowcher ; arrived earlier than our allotted time , as the stroll through to get to the embankment where the boat is moored took less time than we had anticipated ( maybe because it was bank holiday monday , and everywhere was deserted ) ; hubby boarded the ship to check if we would be allowed to eat earlier than our booking time , and emerged to tell me it would be was a small steep ramp to get to the gangway , which was wide enough to fit my wheelchair on , and then a downward incline to get to the boat itself , although a kind assistant offered to help my husband , he did manage . at the boat a slight step to get in and then a flight of stairs to the restaurant ; as i can hubby assisted me and the kindly assistant carried my wheelchair up for were seated at a nice table at the side of the boat offering lovely views out onto the , and had our menu explained - our voucher entitled us to courses , starter or dessert with main , plus a glass of prosecco ( and a boat ride on a sightseeing cruise ) . menu was quite small in way of choice ( on the table menu at least ) but we both found enough variety , even though we both chose the same starter and mains . didnt have to wait too long for our starters , we chose the duck , served warm , perfect combination of crisp skin and pinkish meat , along with a slice of garlic bread and raspberry coulis , it was a perfect mains , along with a lovely crisp light prosecco , were served with just the right amount of time between - again we both chose the same , chicken , served with carrot puree , carrots , peas and rainbow chard , again all done perfectly and added some extra drinks - a cocktail for me ( pier ? ) a long drink , very , but at a time , a tad too expensive , a pint for hubby and at wasnt too bad , and a litre of water at for a bottle , slightly cheaper than most places in the also decided , as we were so enjoying our time their and the view , that we would buy desserts - chose their take on an eton mess sort of thing which has huge , but delicious , hubby took creme brulee served with a crumbly shortbread biscuit ; both were very nice , but the starters took the edge over the desserts unusually . sponge in the mess thing however was spent a very enjoyable few hours there , and could have easily stayed for the evening , drinking wine on the outer deck , however we had places to be , so las had to leaving we checked out the loo 's ; no adapted loo , but the ladies were on the same deck as the restaurant , and the door enabled the wheelchair to be pushed to it , but not suitable if you can not get out of your chair and walk a few the boat posed an additional challenge - we were now at low tide , so the gangway was at an impossibly high slope ; again staff came to help , but it did pose a challenge . , if you need access maybe check tide tables and go to in all , staff were brilliant , helpful and very chatty , food was excellent and very tasty , the boat trip can be used untill the winter , so extra useful , and the wowcher was excellent value . would definitely return !",4.0

"placed restaurant that can be found in a side street between and cut above any fast equivalents , and a place where burgers and output are treated with respect and priced visited at a quiet time on a afternoon ; just us and two other groups in residence . a big place - there 's a versatile bar at one end of the room which is from the restaurant which itself is side on to a small open kitchen . dark and basic inside , but lightened by a full length plate glass window . had the prime spot overlooking the not very interesting street with a dull view of the rear end of an office compact menu is very appealing for those of a carnivorous nature , and certainly would have been more bullish with my selection had it not been lunchtime . it was , went for the pulled pork which arrived in a small pan accompanied by a little of excellent french fries flavoured with rosemary , a tiny pot of tasty sauce and some coleslaw , all presented on a board . n't say that the pulled pork conveyed much evidence of having been smoked in hickory for hours ( as indicated on the menu ) , but it was all serviceable shredded meat , and the sauce did perk it up a bit . colleague 's lamb and feta burger looked more the part ; meaty and firm , although the accompanying yogurt sauce did n't really zing it up very much . , neither us left really the place for an expansive wine list but the abbreviated choice gave focus , and our robust reds did the were ably looked after by the efficient girl who greeted us at the bar when we arrived . manager was also very amiable whilst we were sorting out the a visit , and my tip would be to not go for the soft option but try something big and meaty with all the traditional sides .",3.0

"for early dinner with my daughter , we had a burger each though can not remember which , the food was well presented , tasty and hot service was polite and friendly , when we asked about drinks we were told that cocktails were for for that hour so we ordered different ones between the of us , they came in twos so we did n't have to rush them but as it was they did n't last long as they were so nice , would go back again in a heartbeat .",5.0
"is such a great venue , highly recommend for discrete business lunches , team meetings or even dinner for two . food is excellent , the service top notch and the wine selection and related advise from the servers second to none . are lovely tapas on offer which can be great for small starters or something to have after work rather than a full to we had a one-off sub-par experience for a group of ten and the management issues vouchers to everyone in that is how a restaurant should deal with a complaint . single person will be returning as a result and recommending well done !",4.0

"were seated easily as a walk-in on a night around . server offered us a booth ( we said we 'd love that ) but then seated us at a normal table for , which was a bit odd . ordered small plates & a large one between us , a cocktail and a glass of wine . first problem was difficulty getting water . requested tap water in the first instance but had flag down a server to repeat that request after ordering and then waiting about minutes . server then brought a bottle of table water , filled our small glasses but took the bottle away again . asked if we could keep the bottle and she said no , the bottle is for the whole restaurant ( there were about bottles of table water on the bar and a lesser number of tables occupied in the restaurant , she could easily have left it with us ) . returned later with a small carafe of which we had to request a refill half way through our meal after it had sat empty for quite a while . problem was each dish , down on the table without announcing what it was . dishes were recognisable but the first one for example did n't look like at all ( it 's a loose interpretation , a mound of potato semolina with cheese and tomatoes - tasted great but we did actually have to ask which dish this was ! ) and really the price point of 's expected some identification as the plates were brought what soured the experience were the two on our bill . spotted two items that had n't thought were nearly so pricy when we ordered . was with a very old friend and had no qualms about questioning this . server went away to check the bill and came back having corrected one price . did n't have a menu to compare to and after she had just checked it did n't want to push further but suspected one of the other prices was wrong . paid . leaving checked the menu outside and found that yes ! had still charged us for another dish that was meant to be ! back inside went , again , to point out the overcharge and get the difference refunded . really annoys me that had to do that after already asking her to check the bill once . lot of people would find it too embarrassing or would think it not worth it . 's how places get away with this kind of nonsense . 's really not acceptable . was dining with a very old friend who is of a similar mindset to me , if i 'd been on business or a date might have felt unable to address the issue . back 'm really irritated that we paid a % service fee for fairly poor service and if we had n't been on the ball would have been scammed out of the price of a whole extra dish . were one of the last to leave the restaurant that night . these seemed to be the prices automatically put on the bill from the till , 'm quite sure that they overcharged everyone who ordered those two dishes this - imagine how much extra they 've skimmed like that ! ok. n't be back . because we enjoyed the food .",2.0
"would just like to personally thank restaurant for the beautiful meal we had yesterday for my birthday ; we had the seven course tasting menu and it was truly magnificent . the moment we walked in the service was world class , all of the staff and waiters were really attentive and they all seemed genuinely passionate about the dishes - especially the sommelier . was highly professional and extremely knowledgable about all of the ingredients of the food and how it was sourced and prepared - we loved the way he managed to give us all of the information in a clear and friendly way yet remained discreet and left us enough gaps and private time to enjoy our meal alone . really was one of the most interesting , varied , modern and delicious meal experiences we have ever had . love food but this was on a completely different level to anything we have ever tasted before . is clear why this restaurant and chef have the stars ; the food was stand out exceptionally good and what made the whole meal extraordinary was the outstanding customer service . you so much , we will be highly recommending you to friends and family and ca n't wait till we can return ourselves in the future .",5.0

"here for lunch & the pizza cost about . a decent size , struggled to finish it . the one with chorizo and was delicious . 'd say it took between minutes to be to other branches , this is more of a court ' thing than a restaurant it 's going to be quicker & cheaper than the upstairs if you just want a pizza whilst shopping or before cinema .",4.0
"found this restaurant on top table and we decided to give it a go before our theatre visit , we had a table on the mezzanine overlooking the bar below , great mix of the smart restaurant and the buzz of the bar below , food and service were both very good , had we not had to rush off for the theatre would have liked to relax in the bar below , would definitely recommend .",4.0

"over internet as my wife had been here over years ago and wanted to see if it was the same . both went for the set menu at we had a window overlooking the and and of course the river ! better than most restaurants could offer . menus are often second rate , but this was everything but , with a choice of four starters , mains & deserts all well presented and equivalent to a la carte options . it was a windy night it was a little like eating on a cruise ship as the boat gently moved on the swell which was fun . would both eat here again next time we are in .",4.0
food and great service . tasted genuine and interesting . a huge change from the run of the mill restaurant who all have exactly the same dishes .,5.0
"of us dined here a couple of weeks ago . were greeted in a business like manner , our coats were taken and we were shown to our table . waiter came along and gave us a warm welcome as he gave out menus and returned soon after to take our drinks order . of and of . over the menu for some time and our waiter answered any questions we had . the end had a crab salad starter , halibut main course and a delicious cheesecake dessert . food was cooked to perfection . was a great experience , too expensive to visit too often but great as an occasional treat . of my colleagues had the steak and kidney suet pudding ( a speciality dish ) which they both said was delicious .",4.0
"was quite nice - as expected . cooked our steaks the wrong way round - mine was well done instead of being medium rare and my partners was medium rare when he had asked for well forgot to bring us the sauce completely and only brought the spinach when we asked them . we told them about the mistakes there was no apology or acknowledgement - we were just told he would let the chef know ! ! ! the amount you pay was very disappointed in the service and missing food and will certainly not be going back to this , my partner had to ask for more wine from our bottle as he 'd been sitting for minutes with an empty glass .",2.0

in with my son and friend to get them a quick burger . was really slow for a . think they were recovering from lunch time rush and preparing for the evening . it surprising that they do n't offer a childrens menu so we had to order from the main menu . burgers were ok but not exceptional . 've tasted better . milkshakes were delicious but took about half an hour to make . ok but for a place that specialise in burgers they were average .,3.0
visited this pretty while in the and found it to be a sanctuary of coffee and good conversations . recommend visiting while in town .,5.0
"tables available due to lack of staff so had to wait minutes for one to become got the table , sat there for a further minutes but just got blanked , no service , no drink , no orders , no staff to cover shifts and too big to even informed but he could n't care to give it star as there was no option to leave none .",1.0
"n't fault the service , they were incredibly courteous and attentive , food was delicious , freshly prepared and authentic . of everything we tried , the only dish would critique is the chilli mushrooms as they were a little too sweet for my taste . all of the other dishes were perfect and will certainly be going back .",4.0
salad was great . lamp rump could have been bakewell was absolutely staff is quite resourceful and come back .,3.0
"pub was empty when we arrived about saw the menu and had a very good lunch , with excellent real ale .",5.0
"is unsurprisingly set in an old dairy in an area where one would not expect to find this kind of trendy but still is first worth a visit for the building itself starting from the outside walls decorated with , a large space furnished with recycled chests , tatty sofas and baroque lightening create a welcoming atmosphere leaving breathing space for the punters , though it can get very crowded on a . menu proposes an interesting choice of dishes beside the traditional roast . , sea bass , venison , but also gnocchi ( delicious ) , fish cake and the roasts ( lamb and pork ) were nice but not exceptional , the sea bass was tasty but unfortunately served on a bland bed of cheap prawn and pulses in a tomato sauce . venison stew was bar offers an interesting range of foreign beers in particular and other fruity is a place visit or times a year but this is my first review and think that though the originality and appeal are still there , the quality of the food has gone one notch down in recent months . a good and recommended place for a pub lunch .",4.0

"this was a moderate priced restaurant , the food was excellent and so were the staff . our waiter was friendly , funny and so very helpful . the surrounding were interesting and the seating area was comfortable , my only grumble was that the restaurant was very dimly lit which gave trouble when trying to read the menu , even with my spectacles on i had trouble reading the small print ,",5.0
"it really came down to had to get up from our table twice to order drinks at the bar as the staff continously walked past us and did n't hear us calling for attention or even look in our direction . we did order a drink at the table , the bill was given and settled and we were asked to leave the table before they had even arrived ! ! starters were left on the table and the mains came out . had to ask the staff to clear the plates so that our food could be put food was not warm and out of the meals four were eaten and finished before the had even come out . was so not very busy therfore we could n't understand the poor service and late food . a great birthday dining then had pounds roughly , service charge on our bill which we paid to avoid the mood being even more as it was a celebration dinner however this just added insult to injury . single table in the bar was reserved so we could n't sit and enjoy the music . a hour journey to the venue , bad service and cold food , we disappointed . think had the service been better we would have stood and enjoyed the pianist for a while !",2.0
the prices they charge would like more than a bowl of lukewarm not that tasty ramen . blad ramen can be satisfying if its hot and the noodles are good . they committed the ultimate ramen sin and wont be going back . be going to bone daddies round the corner instead,2.0
"food is quite authentic for being outside of . importantly , the price is reasonable for ( and no less ) . food is mostly all right there in front of you and you can choose either rice or noodles as your base and then add , or different types of food to your plate . chose three vegetarian dishes for friend had the roti canai which was probably the most authentic 've had outside of . service is friendly as well . highly recommend this place , but it would probably be better to go with someone who knows a little about cooking . was my second visit to after two years , by the way . it 's just as good as my first visit .",4.0
"'s : the `` bread '' was more a french sweet . daughter ( only ) refused to : for a bottle of water ? ? took bottle only for a water ! be careful if you are thirsty you could be really in a trouble ! : they call that is true just the dish ! the portion were very poor small piece of chicken ( really ! ) a tortilla wrap ( cold ) and coleslaw for call this very creative ! very very creative ! the end guys be careful , do n't waste your money ! you will be very disappointed ! and to be honest pretty angry also i understand why on the bill it was include % of `` discretionary tips '' could be so silly to leave even a pence ! !",1.0
"took my elderly disabled out for lunch here and was impressed with the food and service . from the start when made the booking we were made to feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble . was using a deal that had seen and it was a pleasant change not to be treated as has often been the case in the past when using one of these vouchers . friendly owner was very helpful with regards to explaining what was on offer and making suggestions when asked as to what dishes would complement each other . food came well presented , seasoned and hot . was plenty of it and the homemade puddings that followed , pie and raspberry cheesecake were to die for . do other offers at lunchtime and a fab cocktail offer on & nights . experienced such a favourable introduction to this restaurant will most certainly be returning to !",5.0
"visited the at 's on a evening recently . was far less busy than we expected at the start of the weekend so service was prompt ; my wife ordered sea bass and went with the seafood of the dishes were fine , well cooked , well presented and tasty . , the portions felt as if they were strictly controlled and , perhaps unreasonably , could imagine that someone in the kitchen was counting out the precise number of pieces of squid , shrimp etc . to include in the impression aside , the food was fine , if , the prices reasonable , given the location , and the service was excellent . will certainly consider revisiting this restaurant when am next in this interesting part of .",3.0

"fan of and always visit the branch which is top notch . the branch last week and overall the experience was poor . was n't that busy when we arrived and we found both the service and food were poor . beer was room temperature and not at all cold . mentioned this to the staff and there response was its always like this , fair play they took it off the bill though . was the worst have experienced in to date , green curry was tasteless and my chilli prawn dish was simply horrid . our food was delivered no one asked us how the food was and we ate , paid our bill using the app and left and no one even noticed ? ? ? ? ? experience has put me off eating food for a while future if get the urge to eat again will stick to the branch , the branch just did n't hit the mark on service or food quality .",2.0

"is no specific seating for this food outlet , only communal seating shared with a few other food outlets , so at busy times it can be difficult to find seats if you are in a group , and you may get people sitting next to you at your table as well . if you are looking for a restaurant vibe then this is n't the service is very fast . pizza is made to order and is cooked while you are waiting . tastes amazing . pizza is n't greasy at all like in other commercial pizza takeaways . pizza has a bit of a crust , but the rest of the pizza is pretty thin . would say its inches in diameter , so enough for one person for lunch at least . for dinner too if your not a massive eater .",4.0
"was my first visit in that chain , but the first impression is positive ! on is very spacey with nicely dimmed light . can select table for two , with couches , or round big cosy tables for larger was very tasty , just could be a little big bigger . the prices are very nice as for . was surprised how `` teas '' like lemongrass or jasmine are served . are not tea with flavour , but actually an infusion of . think 've seen it this for the first time - original and natural - like but no least - do you know restaurants with nice , stylish interior and out of nowhere ? is not a case here ! for cohesion !",4.0

"of us went for dinner on a evening which is wine if you wish . enjoyed some good real ale , a realy nice from their wine list and a bottle of white that we took . food was very good , potted shrimp & prawn , tuna carpaccio and fishcakes to start , followed by scallops and burgers for main . waitress was very pleasant and efficient and the atmosphere was very busy but fine . : % service charge is automatically added to your bill which on this occassion was happy to pay , although the idea of including it does slightly annoy me ! very enjoyable meal , recommended .",4.0
"are usually a safe bet but this place was really very poor . enquired about a table for two the member of staff said she would come back to me but she . eventually found someone else who was sufficiently interested to find us a table within view of the bar . restaurant was busy but not manic and the atmosphere was very pleasant . that was the only positive thing that can say about our visit as the food was pretty poor . son and both ordered burgers ' which large and succulent portion of meat which actually turned out to be two smaller burgers . would have been perfectly fine if they had been nice to eat but the burgers had been cooked to death . were , dry , and dense as if they had been heated twice or left to shrivel and harden . truly pathetic offering for around each . possible to get a pint of beer as the row of beer taps at the bar were covered by a cloth suggesting that they were out of commission and when asked for bottled beer shown on the menu card was told that it was not . for such a large restaurant that attracts a high proportion of tourists . could have complained of course , but this would have embarassed my year old son who just wanted to cut our losses and leave . gave our server to cover the and something bill . must had awarded himself the change as his tip as that was the last saw of him . management of this branch of 's are falling down badly and even if it is a typical trap it should not be as bad as have described . somewhere else .",1.0

"after work meal with colleagues . was buzzing - not the place to go for a quiet meal , but a good vibe . was pleasant and efficient . steak and chips was good quality and tasty . only complaint is that the board it was served on was not conducive to adding a sauce . poured over the steak , this spilled straight on to the table and dripped onto my trousers . was not the only one with the same problem . on a communal garden plate and it would have been perfect !",4.0
"was invited to lunch at the by friends visiting , we had also gone at the same time last year . is in a beautiful position , light and airy . relaxed in the lounge section of the dining room , and were served with drinks before going to the service was impeccable , the food hotel itself is next to and on , close to numerous buses and the tube station .",5.0
ordered a takeaway from last night and they seemed to mess everything up ! ordered via and was told it would be delivered at . them at and they seemed to have no idea about my order but said it would be with me and mins . waited another minutes and called back to see what the problem was . again they seemed to have no idea what was talking about and had to recite all items 'd ordered . said it would be minutes later called and they said he had already been to my house and had me which he had n't as had my phone on me . apologised and said they will send him back so stood outside my house in the cold waiting for the delivery man . finally nearly running me over in the process then started getting his phone out to try and say he had been calling me . this time was so annoyed just asked for my food and went inside . unfortunately it does n't end there . had given me a completely different pizza which was cold as was the garlic bread . so annoyed at this point had to get my boyfriend to call them back . get me wrong they were very apologetic and sent a new pizza and garlic bread straight away which was much appreciated . food was ok but maybe next time we will dine in as they seem to not care about takeaway orders .,2.0

"give some background to this review , am a huge fan of , have all of his books , follow his shows ( except the ones on the sink estates ) and in fact have cooked hundreds of his recipes over the years ( successfully might add ) and 'm a big supporter of the way he tries to educate us to be brave and experiment with food . the way cook and wo n't ( normally ) hear a bad word said about the guy ! now that is . were in to see a show and wandered around and planned to eat before heading to the and had a place in mind that we had been to before . on seeing the menu on the wall of this restaurant with 's name emblazoned on the menu we went in absolutely positive we were in safe hands . restaurant looks trendy , the staff were friendly , polite and there were lots of them , despite only a small handful of customers . 's not like me to venture into any restaurant without checking first , and our experience here reminds me why . was a very cold night and it looked inviting with wall heaters and plenty ( almost all ) tables free . could possibly go wrong ? the starters available did not inspire us to choose any ( disappointed straight away ) so we went straight for mains , we had not noticed the lack of appealing starters before we headed into the restaurant and were seated ready to order . we both ordered mains of pizza described as `` pulled slow roasted pork , apple sauce and with pork crackling '' . sounded different . what arrived was virtually tasteless . small amount of pork that was there tasted nice but the rest of the pizza was bland beyond belief . was also covered with a huge amount of water cress . very trendy but there is only so much watercress a pizza can take ! would have added flavour as well as colour . cress added only colour and attempted to cover the fact that there was little topping underneath . have added pics and do n't be fooled into thinking there is a good amount of pork on the pizza , what you can see is mainly crackling . ordering the pizza we looked for a nice dessert to order after the main but the choice was awful . ' roll , blueberry tart , black forest gateaux or cheese and biscuits or ice cream . get that they are trying to rejuvenate the food from the seventies but the very few choices left me uninspired . publicity wrongly states their pizzas are `` universally loved ! '' beg to differ . also states they aim to take us on a `` journey of discovery through and reintroduce us to familiar flavours '' are so many fabulous innovative dishes available today it seems odd and just wrong on every level to want to bring back something that went out of favour because better choices came along ? makes me shudder to think the tourists coming here will leave thinking this is what our top chefs are capable of . was a cold evening , there were heated seats and overhead heaters but we were still chilly sitting there so the thought of a cold dessert ? we left without dessert and went instead to a nice coffee bar near the theatre and had a fabulous dessert . can not understand how this wonderful chef can allow this food to be cooked in his name . he got too big and too famous to have time to care ? sincerely hope not but the evidence is that despite bad reviews on here he is not listening . is not the only bad review on here , had read the reviews on here before walking in we would have gone elsewhere . is important what paying customers think . accepting they are subjective , turning a blind eye regardless is a mistake . is a fabulous location and yes it 's probably mainly tourists who are the target market but please let them leave with a great impression of food and not underwhelmed as we were . some of the fabulous recipes from his books would be more impressive there 's no shortage of inspirational recipes available . work well and taste delicious , sadly ca n't say the same about the food on offer here . have to speak as find and am sad to say your venture is a huge let down .",2.0

"had not seen our friends from for about months and were delighted to hear that they were coming down with our and his girlfriend . chose the because it looked like a fun environment on a . at pm the place was heaving and our drinks came pretty quickly , and we ordered our starters were delicious , but the main meals were very disappointing . steaks were not cooked as ordered , the burgers were not homemade ( or if they were would ask the chef how and why they were cooked ) . moules however were very good . asked for coffee after the meal and were told that they were just about to clean the coffee machine ! ! ! ( this was at ) we got our coffee after some negotiation . will not be going back .",3.0

went to and after a trip to market on a quiet lunchtime . is a nice old pub with friendly staff and prompt service . and drinks were very reasonable prices . it was very quiet there was not much of an of an atmosphere and we should go back to try at at an evening when expect it is busier .,4.0
"was good , main course portions a bit small considering price , but it was probably the waitress firstly telling an individual in our group to keep the noise down after laughing once in the half full restaurant then quite annoyingly constantly reminding us ( party of ) when we had to leave the table for the next booking , that eventually left a very bitter taste in our mouths . in our party who were visiting from overseas and out of town were surprised and like myself are unlikely to return to this establishment . get the distinct impression of could care less !",3.0
"food was good as always . use to going to the one in street , am use to the great service . service was not very good here . had to ask four times to get a glass of water ( from different staff ) and the food was pretty slow to come out to be honest . would definitely go to the one in street over this branch !",3.0

've been to so many places which claim to be able to cater for large groups , but serve up cold custard , or overcooked beef . was phenomenal . our guests had left , we were given a complimentary glass of prosecco . would recommend this pub to anyone looking for a great meal at a reasonable price , and a chilled out .",5.0

decided to take my friend for my second visit and just love the ambience and the food at this place . received exceptional service from the restaurant manager and the waiter was very attentive and friendly . ordered a steak tartare as a starter to share followed by a duck and lamb mains . dishes were delicious ! dessert is divine too ! restaurant is glamorous and elegant . will definitely be taking more friends and colleagues to dine at this beautiful place in the near future !,5.0
"have gone here numerous times but have not been for a while and from a recent visit , the menu has been updated but the problem is that the prices have now gone up but the portions have significantly downsized which is extremely disappointing as the hunger for bigger margins has now put me completely off eating at this chain again .",2.0
"welcome and comfortable seating , it was a bit hard to find the restaurant but well worth the extra effort to enjoy our & meal as it was so the first time in my life to enter a it was a good experience even the kids they have enjoyed over would come more and more for the worm atmosphere with a delicious food . prices for central were reasonable with fairly traditional classic pub with pleasant upstairs dining area . sure we will visit again ! it up",5.0

"took my friend to the for her for a course meal with sparkling effort made was fantastic , the food delicious . waitress lou was a credit to the management time and effort put into the meal was worth it a credit to the restaurant was quiet this lunchtime but the atmosphere was good . had service at the appropriate times without being . we would highly recommend this courses cost each plus drinks . views of the london eye .",5.0
"were good , however the service was slow throughout , some of our orders were wrong and one meal was so late it was barely eaten . disappointing and would n't recommend .",2.0
"a winner . food - very ordinary . rolls for starters were heavy ( wrap too thick ) and green curry okay but far from memorable . from others around the table were the same - generally inoffensive but nothing better . - very poor . , there were around of us , but we had booked in advance , were early in the evening , and the restaurant was not exactly busy . course took a long time before we were all served . lost count of the rice dishes etc , placed it on the table without thought so that people did n't know they were sharing / others could n't reach , and actually tried to sort it out when someone complained that their rice had n't arrived by taking a dish off the table and moving it while someone else was actually serving themselves . it have hurt just to bring one more ( which they did when the table protested - but then stood around and counted everything ) ? is . the fault of the diners that the staff were slow , did n't get everything out at the same time , forgot some dishes , and did n't place the according to where they were are many good places to eat in , so do n't waste your time on this one .",2.0
service 've experienced in many years . all the worse by the fact that there were as many staff as there were tables in the nearly empty restaurant . were totally indifferent to our presence in their average for the money . worse quality and smaller portions than it used to reasonable chain bought out from the original owners and totally destroyed .,2.0

mother and had lunch here after 'd enjoyed their afternoon tea on a previous occasion . were n't disappointed visiting again . hotel itself is charming and has real character . bar area is warm and inviting with excellent service and a great range of wines and cocktails . ate off the a la carte menu - had the butchers steak . was perfectly cooked with generous portions - really tasty . old school puddings were fantastic and not at all like how they tasted at school ! the chocolate pudding with chocolate custard - best dessert think 've had ! service was attentive without being intrusive and the dining area is relaxing and comfortable . it here and will definitely return .,5.0
to the restaurant at christmas time with my . was is in the heart of covent gardens courtyard . the seating section is outside there is heating and was plenty warm enough . food was very good and fast service . was a little que but only about minute wait for a seat . location was beautiful inside the courtyard with the xmas decorations hanging above and the noise of shoppers passing by . selection of food and would visit again . lots of markets shops and street entertainers around convent gardens great atmosphere . of my favourite places in .,5.0
"is not a part of tourists are likely to visit - not in the evening anyway . could twin this with a few drinks at the , just round the have been times and enjoyed the polite , efficient and quick service . will see a reassuringly large proportion of diners here , even in the is very much on fish , with a few meat and veg options including tempura but no noodle soup . that the sushi is served on warm rice , as it should be . pickles and sake very well kept of the best places in .",4.0
"had meaning to eat here for ages and finally got around to it on . frankly wished had n't 've never left a negative review of anywhere before , normally give places the benefit of the doubt , but there were few redeeming features in this only one can think of actually , is that it is a nice building and quite a cosy atmosphere inside . is where the positives begin and service was abysmal , not a personal attack on the staff ( they were pleasant enough ) , but they were so inattentive it was almost farcical . sat there for about minutes before anyone even bothered to take drinks orders and this theme continued throughout the food was at best what would describe as average grub has its place , but if you are paying gastro pub prices , you feel like you are being is grossly overpriced for what they offer and the pricing is totally illogical , for example scampi costs as a starter and as a main what that extra gets you is extra pieces of scampi and some pretty foul green salad . 'm not sure how they arrive at this price , but it does n't make much sense unless they are actually trying to rip their customers really needs to decide what it wants to be . a nice building and probably a nice place to have a pint if they want to serve poor food and not bother training their staff properly , then fine , but they really need to drop all the pretence and lower their prices . they want to be a then they seriously need to think again about their whole offering . for one wo n't be going back and spending ( adults , one small child ) , until they do",1.0
"our last night in we wanted to go somewhere spectacular and we were not let down . menu , food , service , atmosphere and not really expensive , this is a unique wonderful place to visit for special occasions , or often if you can . food was so beautifully presented and very delicious . had courses and a bottle of wine . staff were professional , courteous at all times , and very thorough . remained aware of our tight timescale but we were not rushed in any way . needs were more than catered for . one of the better restaurants 've been to . not have asked for a better meal to end our first trip to . without saying that on our next visit , we will be returning .",5.0
"we waited minutes for our starter , then another minutes for the main . when the main came there was no mayo in our burger when the menu stated that there would mayo inside it , we asked them twice for mayo nobody came . got so frustrated and had to get up myself and ask again because there was no waiters around which i do not understand why . to this experience i will never step inside any friday restaurant , definately not this branch . service was terrible , we asked the waiter for tissue , she said `` there is one on the table already '' yet there was of us on the table .",1.0

"had dinner with my family a couple of days ago and had a between us . bottle was priced around but the catch is that it had a sticker on it ( on the back side , which the staff missed ) that said `` not to resale '' along with the name of the distributor which have redacted . jokingly told the waitress that hope we do n't get charged the full price for a sampler , she actually asked if had put the sticker there myself , took the bottle away and then denied the whole thing from ever happening . be honest , get it - its hard to run a family business , and its hard to keep it in the current climate but honestly , a simple apology would have been enough rather than this attitude . 's a shame because the food was great but the whole experience left us with a bad taste .",2.0
"the moment we arrived and the door was opened smartly we were met by a grumpy indifferent chap on the desk , not a good start admit but once we were past him and shown to a comfortable seating area , all changed . staff were superb and engaged with us in our experience of dining at . menu somewhat , the reason we went in the first place , did not disappoint and enjoying the steamed steak and kidney pud with a tankard of best ale was the a brilliant combination of flavours and textures , thank goodness for the little pot of gravy . a splendid place to be and had it not been for the grumpy chap at first , it would have rated five stars , , the waiters more than made up for that bit of failing and we so enjoyed our lunch , we determined to return . in all , an exceptional place to be with lots of fine traditions .",4.0

have had the steak and bottle of wine deal several times now . service is first class and the with the deal the food is drink is tremendously good value for the area and the quality establishment . have also had the afternoon tea with free flowing champagne which was equally superb and gold to see that that champagne deal is back on again after a short relapse to the much less appealing .

"visit to , the last one was months ago , the menu has changed quite a bit and so has the wine menu , items we had all been looking forward to no longer there which was a real shame but change is what keeps things fresh so have to accept and wine were as always fantastic and could not be faulted at all , what was a shame is the front of house has gone down hill , no real smiles or warm friendly ness anymore , we were early so having a drink at the bar and mentioned to one of the team walking past that we had a table booked and wanted to just say we are here , promptly she pointed to the gathering of ladies around a desk to enter the restaurant and told us to go over there and tell them we bothered her as she was busy we could tell as she went and joined the ladies at the said desk and had a conversation about well i can only assume the weather because i still had to go over and say we had were a few other moments with coat collection etc which all just spoilt the service you expect in a place like the restaurant though could not fault the service it was excellent as always .",3.0

"absolutely love this place and recommend it to many people who have enjoyed it too . is the perfect place to pick for an afternoon tea or lunch . have reasonably priced options for unlimited ( not ! ) and they are not stingy about serving it . afternoon tea is great , you can opt for traditional or gentlemen 's afternoon tea . gentlemen ’ s afternoon tea consists of sausage roles and steak and snail sandwiches as well as cakes . lunch menu is just as good , the food is well cooked and the portions are generous . are happy to host big groups so it would be a great place to celebrate a birthday without the drink prices mounting staff are friendly and nice and they design of the bar and restaurant is as good as any hotels . criticism would be that there is only one ladies toilet meaning you can find yourself in a small queue , which is n't really what you want during your meal .",5.0

"is the second time have visited this restaurant . time was a business lunch and we sat indoors . pasta with clams and white wine sauce was amazing . went with another business colleague and sat outdoors on a bench in the sun , in , watching the world go by . had penne with clams , , king prawns and squid . was delightful . people had pizzas that looked so large and amazing had menu envy even though my dish was great . staff are so friendly and if you want penne instead of tagliatelle or spaghetti , to be able to prevent embarrassing eating , it is no problem . totally recommend and will definitely return .",5.0

"the last evening , the place was packed , do n't know what the walk in policy is ( we had pre booked ) , dark inside but the views of make it is great , make sure you order the fat fries they are delicious , steaks are brought to your table before you order so the cuts are shown and explained to you , very helpful if you 're unsure what to order , sides prices are around a fiver each , steaks from upwards , wines from upwards , not a cheap night but well worth a visit as a view from you table !",5.0

"been here once in the past month and sat in the restaurant as well as ordering food for delivery and could n't recommend it menu is extensive so we asked what the waiter would choose and he gave us some great suggestions . of the food is absolutely delicious and all the ingredients really everything tasted really loved . absolute favourite was the smoky chicken starter ( think that 's what it 's called ) - honestly , could live off one food forever think that would be it ! ! staff were all so helpful and our waiter was such a smiley charming nothing was too much trouble for vibe of the restaurant is pretty relaxed and there were lots of different groups of ladies and couples a good mix of people . would recommend this restaurant to groups of friends as well as family get together and couples eating out . was pretty loud in the restaurant which guess might be something to think fantastic evening and worth noting that even when you order take away the food is just as delicious . huge thumbs up",5.0

in here on a night . bizarre frankly - it looked as if a few people had sat around an office trying to come up with a new concept for a restaurant and tried to tick a lot of boxes . it did not work and the basics were appalling . example ordered grilled fish as a main but they had sold out - of one of only a handful of non pizza dishes on the menu on a night ? swapped for a lamb steak which when it arrived it was without question the worst lamb steak 've ever tried to eat - the waitress ( who as other reviewers have noted are very friendly ) noticed how bad it was as she walked past and promptly asked the chef to make another . obvious point - how does a young waitress clock a bad dish whilst walking across a restaurant when the chef who cooked it let it come out of his kitchen . could go on but the whole restaurant is a mish mash of concepts - which at best simply does not work and at worst is very very poor .,1.0
"again we had to revisit this café . were happy to talk about the again and we had meals and drinks . ai n't a classy joint .

have now visited twice first time was approximately ten years ago and did not review it suffice to say all our meals went back as they were cold . when invited recently to meet some friends we felt we should give it another chance . felt it was certainly expensive but with its history we expected that . my pheasant was boring and my partner chose the roast hate and not only was it cold but also tasteless which was disappointing as the waiter had enthused about it . were ok but nothing to write home about and the gentleman who brought the wine had no idea and when we said the wine smelt musty he was quite rude . after decided we would order a different wine he admitted the previous bottle was corked . will be a long time before we go again . are living on their reputation of being the oldest restaurant in,3.0

"quality of food here is way up there , especially compared to its competitors . a vegetarian can get pretty decent stuff and it all tastes really good but one major criticism have is that nearly all the vegetarian sandwich / wrap type things involve mayonnaise cheese . most cases they include both cheese and mayo and in copious amounts , everything . only is this annoying for vegans , or those trying to cut down on dairy and eggs , but it does n't even make sense when usually the sandwiches are already full of things like houmous that completely negate the need for mayo or cheese - it 's just weird and demonstrates what seems to be a fear that customers have palates that ca n't appreciate anything unless it 's lubricated in cheesey or eggy be fair need to add the `` salad '' type meals for are extremely substantial and although seems expensive in a food chain the meal you get does not skimp on protein rich tasty foods like lentil salad / falafels and you get an all round very reasonable portion for everything involved including the colourful variety of other vegetables - all well dressed / seasoned . have gotten this kind of thing for lunch before and it made a pretty decent meal , not heavy but not leaving you hungry either . satisfying and tasty . noteworthy is that all coffee seems to be organic so kudos on that one - only place 've seen this up to now . always get a strong black coffee and should note it usually tastes good . do n't think 've been to any coffee shop where the coffee was consistently good - sometimes you get a bad one - just the way it goes so this is not a criticism of . fruit usually tastes really good and all the sweet treats are a cut above the competition as like 's serious attempts to bring an ethical attitude to the forefront in the business , especially compared to the more token gestures made by other fast food the staff have always been great as well .",5.0

"– the restaurant looks great : cosy and full of atmosphere , a nice buzz in the air . – why oh why do they have to have thumping music more suitable for clubbing ? clientele wasn ’ t especially young – more for the benefit of the staff than the customers ’ d guess . – friendly and attentive service . – how much the charming young lad actually knew about or food is questionable . – good mix of starters , my favourite course by far . – the rest of the meal – at best just average . fritto misto just too soggy and chewy , the batter flaking off , the mackerel tartare tasted mainly of vinegar . vegetables were the best bit . were advised to order dishes each to share , it was a bit too much for us , but then others have complained about small portions so hard to judge guess . , if rather expensive , bottle of wine , coffees and that was gone . didn ’ t feel ripped off but didn ’ t feel cared for . best restaurants make you feel as if the chef wants to share his love of food with you personally . feels like someone has put together a menu that will sell and the food on the plate . you like it – well and good but if customers along in a minute .",3.0

restaurant in town ! ! firm favourite of mine the look of the restaurant not like the swanky style you would expect when you arrive the restaurant the waiters say how many and shout upstairs or downstairs it 's on many levels the service is awful to be honest they are rude and sharp but the food is well worth it the traditional restaurant feel there was a queue out the door which shows how popular it is food is great with an wonderful menu full of traditional food we ordered quite a few dishes including chicken and sweet corn soup with is my favourite and is great for kids in black bean was awesome and the great spice balance price is great and their and value for money it is cash only and the menu is limited the service is n't great but the food is the best you can find in ! !,5.0
"choice and variety , service good . salad was really nice . the salt and pepper prawns too .",4.0
"started off with forgetting all our starters and mains arriving without any acknowledgement of our missing starters . did gave to say to the waitress , `` please take the starters off the bill '' at which point she realised they had never the mains , hmm , mediocre would be generous . chefs special was ceaser salad . for a small portion of grilled chicken on a bed of just about there salad leaves with tiny ( teeny ) grated amounts of , grated so small that the flavour was just lost . had crumbs of croutons , and by crumbs , i would describe them as six petit pois size croutons that if we had not joked about , would have missed . have had a better salad in a premier inn ! desserts , yet another disappointment . ordered the tart warm with warm vanilla custard , what arrived was cold tart with a cup of very cold single cream . waitress did not tell us that there was no vanilla custard , so upon pouring it on and expecting a warm dessert with custard , we had cold pudding with even colder single cream . n all this was the worst have ever spent on lunch . would never eat there again and would advise anyone with any sense not to either . , pretentious and uninspiring . could turn the clock back and never have wasted my hard earned money there .",1.0

": been there twice and it is really a hit and miss experience . it might be good dishes plate out to you but someday it might be bad and bland : ordered thai fried rice the first time i was there and it was n't as fantastic as those ones in . portion size was extremely tiny considering i am a tiny : ordering all the thai curry dishes . you notice , traditionally n't eat a lot of curry dishes unles you come from the very northern part of and or even . of the people in eat fry or spicy papaya salad therefore opt for anything stir fry or papaya salad . will not go wrong ! : my second visit , i ordered ( thai papaya salad ) and it tasted almost exactly like those i had in . am convinced that it was my lucky day because i had tried several other dishes in and it was n't as good as the : charge you for : is very good in , i have no complaints . seems like the staff were train to have good attitude like every other thai in . be nice to : price of the dishes are reasonable enough for you to make a trip to if you need to get some : need to book if you are dining for two . please book if you are going in a big group .",3.0

"a hard day 's work we needed a light and fun meal so thought we 'd try a restaurant in this menu was impressive enough with a wide selection of dishes . a starter the chargrilled chicken wings sounded like fun , finger food . they arrived they were accompanied by nice crunch pickled nibbles . wings however , were very disappointing . tasted as though they had been and were a little dry . main courses of chargrilled pork with spring rolls and noodles and special pork chop rice were distinctly freshly squeezed orange juice and made up for the meal .",3.0
"generally liked the quality of the food when we ate there last week but the service was let down few , nobody likes to be served by someone chewing you feel like someone is out to cheat you if service is already included in the bill , and the payment machine is handed to you asking if you want to add a gratuity .

"wife and went to the for a lovely dinner on a offer for a four course dinner with cocktail and petit fours . had a choice of any cocktail on the menu which was quite extensive and we really found them perfect . good strength of alcohol and ingredients made them punchy but not overly alcoholic . definitely order them again in future . wife ordered the and the 's and both thoroughly enjoyed our own and thought each respectively was the best starters ordered the with cromer crab and tomato risotto , pink grapefruit sauce which found really good . were perfect and not at all . risotto was al dente and a good combo with the tomato but found it slightly under seasoned but still good . combination was just right . wife had the and sherry marinated sea trout , which she found the trout lovely but just a little accompanying lemon or citrus jus would have been perfect to give it a little kick of shared the between us which was good value ( all wines at good restaurants are overpriced anyway ) . strong mineral taste with strong flavours of passion fruit , gooseberry and our mains had my wife had the and had the wife found the duck dish excellent , tender , cooked perfectly , very tasty . the best duck she has ever had . found the very good , perfectly cooked but just a little less tender than expected for some reason . actually might have rather had the duck after having a taste but was generally happy with the steak just not blown dessert my wife had the warm coconut and white chocolate cake with pineapple ice cream . had the vanilla cheesecake with lemon and coriander . my wife 's dessert was actually really lovely and she would definitely order it again , had a quick taste and really thought it was perfect in every way . is one of the best desserts every tasted as well . back to my cheesecake the actual cheesecake was good , not the best but sadly found the was very tarte and overdone with the lemon . both just killed the cheesecake totally . actually had to have a tiny portion with the cheesecake and possibly serving less in the bowl might have been we had a tiny cheese board of amazing cheeses which was perfect . wife does not like strong cheese , and especially goats cheese but this one was really good and she even had two bites . did n't choose coffees thereafter but were served petit fours which we really enjoyed even after a few courses . actually best of all was the bill time so far when we have been to a discounted dinner with groupon or or whatever the restaurant has included the main meal to calculate and then take off the meal . time it was only calculated on what we ordered extra which was the wine plus there was no limit on what we could order on the menu where other places say you can order up to a certain value of the meal this time we had no our waiter and at the reception were really friendly but must say the service was impeccable all round and we felt relaxed with everyone and they were especially concerned about how we were enjoying the experience and the the whole the atmosphere , seating arrangement , ambiance was all actually quite good and well placed . much enjoyed with a lovely hotel in a central location .",4.0

"really liked the atmosphere of the place - dim lights , tables , the smell of incense wafting through the air to supposedly transport you ( in spirit ) to menu is pretty extensive , and there are loads of nice-looking things to try . boyfriend and ordered the ' pad thai ( forgot what it 's called ) , seabass , crispy squid and fried chicken . , the food was good but nothing to shout about . will say that it was better than expected as is a very ' chain in my opinion , so did n't think it would be very authentic . was n't the best food , but that would be asking too much . can be very pricey if you want to try many different dishes ! , will say that the squid was good though . there is any reason to return , it would be for that ! , like other reviews say , would n't return in a hurry .",4.0
"dinner for me and my fiance at . for the live singer , everything else was a disaster . were given our table at . waited then took our order after . , she returned to our table confused and retook our order stating forgot the order ' . starter arrived after half an hour cold and was not having of the mentioned ingredients . just apologized but then later came up to us and mentioned that they have run out of the dish we ordered , we were given an alternate option , which again arrived cold and the meat was not cooked the way we asked for ( well done ) fiance came all the way from and having booked a meal , expected it to be an amazing experience for both of us . it was the complete opposite and we were very dissapointed . completely ruined our evening ! !",1.0

"boyfriend & had a couple of hours before our train in yesterday , and said that 'd buy the dinner if we went to 's , as had n't been in a , maybe there was a piece of plastic in my mashed potato but this review is to outline how helpful our waitress was in assisting my boyfriend in choosing a option . was having a steak , so that was fine , he had the veg ' side and corn on the cob . tucking in , he realised his corn on the cob was coated in something , we called our waitress over and explained . went away and came back with a huge book full of every single ingredient in every single dish on the menu - turns out , they were coated in butter & paprika . meant my boyfriend could continue eating - considering that he carries a syringe of adrenaline around with him just in case he wheat , it was very important that the information given to us was helpful staff , always welcoming atmosphere , good food ( shame about the plastic ) , minute wait at the bar ( we arrived at on a night ) and we 'll be back .",4.0
also do a great is really fresh well cooked tasty food . 's lots of variety . 's a great place for a group dinner - lots of delicious cocktails as well .,4.0
"on and so we just had to try this place while in for the day . and was one of the best have ever had and my used to make some great ones . the but due to the tables being close in the , it is a little claustrophobic and the day we went it was full of rather noisy people which marred the meal somewhat . may be just us , but we like to be able to converse without having to raise our voices but the helpings were generous and the quality more than made up for the atmosphere on the day . certainly go again .",4.0

"really wanted to love because read regularly but the portions were pretty small and the food itself was bland . whole experience felt like eating healthy food years ago when the best mainstream healthy options you could hope for was , spelt crackers and a low fat ready meal . was dry , tasteless and felt like punishment . the desserts we ordered were seriously deficient in sweetness : 've made some of these recipes at home myself to the letter and mine turned out better than the ones in her deli , natural sugar should n't equate to savoury . were also texture issues with the desserts , another old fashioned health food problem . really do n't think that needs to be the case anymore when there are healthy sweet options that are now available at supermarkets and outlets like that do not feel gritty or strange . disappointed friend and ended up going walking to cafe instead , where we had a great dinner . quality of ingredients being used and how they are sourced should never override the reason why people leave their houses and pay for someone to make food for them instead of making it themselves : the food still needs to be good , and at the very least at the same level of what you are capable of making yourself at home . are several places that achieve this without compromising on taste ( e.g . : and ) in order to compete with these places think needs to seriously up their game in the area that counts the most . the staff were very friendly ( they seemed like they were still learning the ropes but they were trying ) and the decor is lovely wo n't be returning because of the food itself which is actually what would have assumed from 's blog and books would be the least of this cafe 's problems .",1.0

"ate here on my first night in . leaving , had to return at least one more time . fish and chips are that good . brownie with the choc mint chip ice cream was also the best . was my favorite place to eat in .",5.0

"to the restaurant with a colleague who had purchased a coupon for . in previous reviews the coupon entitled you to a cocktail , starter , main course , dessert , cheese and biscuits , coffee and petit fours . was sceptical that you would get what you paid for and that staff would try and push wine sales to make up for the reduced price of the meal . single course was delicious and the staff attentive but not overbearing . trio of desserts was a personal favourite . very pleasant experience that would fully recommend .",5.0
"came here after reading the reviews on trip advisor , must say the front of house and staff are amazing . 's where it have never been served such horrible bland food in my life ! was under seasoned and just veg where cooked on mass and cooked from frozen and felt robbed after leaving as it costs as much as good am shocked people like this place , think the front of house takes people 's mind off the bland they sacked the chef and brought someone in that could cook this place would be nice . really hope went on an off day as this should n't be allowed",1.0
"my daughter with me in the and wanted to have a decent sit down breakfast - not a generic cafe . environment and decor . appeared a fair number of breakfast meetings were being conducted , but this did not detract from the light atmosphere - a girl and her father fit right in . were very accommodating with young children . good value with quality food .",5.0
"very close friends are emigrating this month and made the trip from grey , drizzly to for a farewell night friends at home thought was dedicated if not slightly mad ! had discovered this pub as we were staying in the almost directly opposite and popped in for a drink while waiting to check into the hotel & took note it was open until with a arrived here at after leaving a few blocks away which was fine but totally not my thing & wanted some sing a long anthems and a good did not disappoint & from a point of view , was glad to see had some people ' and immediately felt at ease . lads was brilliant , played all our requests for , . etc ; songs which meant a lot to our group and we could murder tragically at the top of our voices . of our group is disabled and as busy as it was , staff and other patrons were super helpful and we were n't made to feel like we were in the way or being awkward unlike some places we 've been in the past . wise there was a decent selection and although more expensive than at home , not excessive and certainly felt worse for wear this morning ! only complaint was the only needed to use them once and while imagine they ca n't make them any bigger , a few staff checks , quick mop of the floor and a top of of toilet roll would be ever return to the area then 'll be sure to pop by , thanks for making our night one to remember .",4.0

"was attentive , with the waiter able to fully explain menu varied and main divine and chicken main very good , but lamb breast was disappointingly fatty ( not properly rendered ) and little actual meat of both the desserts we wanted to order ( we ate at so hardly the end of night ) but they offered us an off menu rhubarb cheesecake , which was possibly the best cheesecake 've ever you 're looking for a family meal in a good bistro , 'd recommend . at a time to best take advantage of their set menus , as the value would have made the issues more would recommend and intend to try their restaurant .",4.0
"went here on a lunchtime with friends from work . its location which is in close proximity to many places of business and that we were there in the middle of a working day we assumed it would be relatively quick as most of the clientele would be on a lunch break from work . ordered some wine , tap water and then our meals . tap water came out quite quickly , followed by the wine . we were interrupted on separate occasions by staff informing us our meals were on their way . alerted us to the fact that the service was very slow and then rather than the meals then coming out quickly , time seemed to go and on and on until we finally got them . nasi goreng was enjoyed by one friend but the seafood laksa deemed to be less tasty than other restaurants . pad thai was massively lacking in flavour so asked for more sauce . was bizarrely then given a big bowl of sweet chilli sauce to go with it ! asked for a deduction in the bill for the slow service and they did oblige so we left happier than we expected but not necessarily keen to return .",3.0

'm a big guy and have eaten many steaks in my time but would go as far to say that the chateaubriand that we enjoyed last night was the best cooked , finest quality fillet au boeuf have ever eaten , perfectly seasoned it was like butter , served simply ( as it should be , all about the meat ) with great crispy fries wilted spinach and a cracking packed with tarragon , amazing ! ! ! must try , and exceptional value at shared a classic fig tart for desert which with the remains of the buttery light was the perfect end to the meal . have n't been to and are uncertain , take it from me , a serious food and classic cuisine fan , this is a straight up slice of authentic brilliance in , you want pretentious frilly over priced food look elsewhere , if you are looking for an intimate boutique restaurant , flavour packed mouthwatering food along with a warm welcome from a wonderful owner and exceptional host , bar none , then look no further .",5.0

restaurant exceeded our expectations . had the shared meat between people and it was absolutely tasty and full of spice . ate with our hands and enjoyed the sharing experience . the waitress said `` is '' . made our experience extra special with her big smile and top notch service . even went around each table and allowed all the customers to smell a pot of roasting coffee beans . were made to feel at home there . highly recommend this place for groups wanting to try a different dining experience .,5.0
"the moment we walked through the door we were treated as very treasured friends . was very attentive , happy and food was amazing . no time did we feel rushed and was wonderful company and very attentive . evening was however somewhat spoiled by the `` '' lady on the next table to us . recollection of her behaviour differs somewhat to hers as she has written in her review . and i had a wonderful meal in good company and were heartbroken to return to our hotel to hear the terrible news of the fellow countrymen of the person responsible for giving us such a wonderful evening . is an experience not to be missed should you ever find yourself in .",5.0
become a regular customer from this restaurant for over a year and half now it tells what think of it . more got to it the more love it as the food and the atmosphere it makes it a nice place to share a plate of pasta or pizza with family and ca n't have enough of having and amazing soft mozzarella cheese that you wo n't be disappointed if you try it . are very good compare to other restaurants as having a good meal for two wo n't cost you a lot . keep the hard work guys and thanks for offering us the residents a nice place to hang around .,5.0

"dear . 've eaten in a few times for weekend brunches and never had a problem . however was an entirely different experience . warning signs were there when we sat down , one waitress , who bless her looked like she was keeping the place going on her own , indicated she was the only waitress today and things might take a little our food order was finally taken , we went for eggs and an egg and bacon sandwich . took around minutes to come , during which lots of food appeared to be coming out and being sent back by tables . warning signs . benedict had overcooked poached eggs but the egg and bacon sandwich was awful . egg was so overcooked it had welded to the bread . was no check back at any point , and then the plates not cleared for a further minutes . plates were cleared by someone who working behind the bar , and when we mentioned the burnt eggs she asked if we had ordered them well done ! ? we were told we should have come and found someone rather than expecting a call back and we should specify we do n't want well done eggs next time . cooked eggs should n't have to be a special request . was a surreal experience and such laughably bad customer service . waiting continued for a bill to materialise , so instead went to pay . out our order was n't even in the system so had to recount what we 'd had , again mentioning the burnt eggs . discount for the poor food and rude service ? , for the bacon added to the egg sandwich , which was something we could actually eat . could n't see any table having a pleasurable experience today , and it 's a shame as we have had good meals there before . after today , we wo n't return and ca n't recommend anyone else does either .",1.0
"a plan gone wrong , frustrating thus far , me and my partner ventured into .

'd printed off some vouchers ( from my dear ) and tried to sort out paying it turned out , although they were accepted fine as they were in our local branch , that an extra code was needed . resulted in a long back and forth phone call checking e-mails to get the correct code . manager was brought in to sort this matter out . handled it well though , everyone seemed patient and friendly and did n't feel any hostile vibes . did have to pay a little out since for some reason one code would not work or something . advice to anyone unsure with e-mail receipt vouchers : you print out every relevant e-mail , even if you get one later on , because it 's less embarrassing than having useless vouchers printed . that cane . realised near the station we 'd forgotten it , we leaned it somewhere before . terrified my partner so we rushed back to get it . was in our spot though and we got it without hassle . overall , 've got faith in this place .

( could have done with coming out of the oven mins before it was served ! ) desserts were delicious , with some lovely combinations of flavours - the hazelnut gateau with a chocolate mousse filling , and a blackberry parfait with a dollop of fresh fruit hiding in the centre . course was just the right size , but after that we were too full even for a coffee . delicious though , and ca n't wait to go back again soon !",5.0

"have to say a very disappointing experience . came in a timely fashion but were mediocre . personally thought they had been bought from and heated . courses arrived . partner had a seafood soup which was absolutely tasteless . like water poured on to noodles . main of beef , onions , peppers and green vegetables tasted like it had been cooked in sugar and only sugar , no chilli at all although having a two chilli rating on the our meal nobody came to ask us how our food was . plates were taken away without anybody asking us how our meal was . bill was bought to us with a service charge automatically . dislike this practice , find it rude and presumptuous . asked for it to be remove stating we were disappointed with the meal . asked what was wrong , apologised or offered us some will not be visiting again .",1.0

at a wedding recently and the reception was held here . food was lovely and modern rather than fancy and hard to pronounce . vegetarian options were plentiful which was splendid for me and there was a cloakroom for our stuff downstairs . only criticism have is that the benches were rather uncomfortable after a few hours of sitting on them as they had no padding . the lovely waitress brought me a cushion to sit all the desserts were brought out at different times and % of my table had finished their desserts and were up dancing before mine had even come understand it was a very busy night and they had a lot of desserts to serve as well as clear up it was a very pleasant night and would definitely go back for dinner again . am very impressed with the bar and wait staff . you for making the evening so lovely and memorable for the happy couple and for going out of your way to be accommodating for such a large party .,4.0

"arrived at on a weekday and ordered a pizza and salad . chicken avocado salad , very tasty and good size . waitress recommended a sausage and broccoli ( looks like the leaves you 'd find on broccoli ) pizza , which had great bread and smoked mozzarella . more authentically as no tomato and quite healthy by pizza standards . the service was a little slow for having plates removed and brought over , but staff were friendly enough . put a `` optional service `` charge on the bill , then do n't know how to change to what you want to pay for service , which is interesting .",3.0

booked a deal for - five course taster menu with bottle of wine . arrival staff were pleasant and we were seated in a booth which was very pleasant for two people in a fairly busy restaurant with several bashes going on . is no offering of breads or bread basket or any nibbles - in truth none of the tables were laid to facilitate such offerings > the waiting staff were charming : the wine included was carafe and not a bottle so we were able to have half white and half red and these were acceptable house vintages and a fairly generous approximation of five courses were nicely presented and very tasty - particularly enjoyed the battered cod cheeks - and cuisine size ( which one would expect on a tasting menu ) - the pudding of pudding clotted cream ice cream and whisky sauce was divine ! charge was only levied on the voucher price and we were told we didnt have to pay it if we didnt want to which thought was rather sweet ! the ambience is somewhat gentleman 's club but off the main bar we enjoyed the experience but doubt that we would ever go back as we are enjoying experiencing so many different restaurants ( particularly attached to hotels where one definitely gets the best value ) using the very many voucher deals available in you can get a deal go - if you are staying in the hotel on business then enjoy at someone else 's expense !,4.0

have loved over the years although it has not changed for better in our views after they renovated the place and introduced the new menu few years ago . used to enjoy their sashimi salad and it was the best in with great flavor and the nigiri tastes good so we will highly recommended it . is probably not the cheapest in but it tastes good and it has a nice homely touch to it for a good conversation between had bentos with chicken and tempura - it was very tasty and rice is probably one of the best ones in . : ) portion of the food is just right for the ladies but maybe a bit insufficient for gentleman . price of bentos is about each so not the cheapest for the portion you get but the presentation certainly is good enough for a good thing that we did n't like is that we waited for more than mins for someone to come back and take our order for dessert especially after we signaled about three time for them to come . ended up just asked for the bill and leave which was a shame to wrap up a nice evening out .,3.0

'm not the world 's biggest sourdough fan , so it 'd be nice if they offered different breads ( one or two choices would be fine ) , and this was my real issue , the just seemed to lack flavour . cheese was a bit , as were the beans and the tuna taste hardly made it through - very disappointing . think the real killer was that the cheese and tuna had very little salt , and just did n't convey their flavour above the me , the answer is n't adding condiments or salt afterwards , this is a melt , not a burger , it should be ready to eat . is n't exactly expensive , it does make 's wrap look like excellent value , which can be had just down the road of those things , but unfortunately , due to lack of flavour , find it hard to give it more than stars .",3.0

"daughter and happened across this place when shops and market were all but shut up for the to be really popular and the menu looked interesting so thought we 'd give it a 's union jacks is by the apple market in . by glass to about '' - allows diners to see out and to see in . seems to be supposedly in flavour - all ingredients being sourced from these shores with the exception of the majority of had to wait minutes - outside the restaurant while they found us a table . family of four who had beaten us to the restaurant had to wait for their table while we were ushered whole place has the ambiance of a shop . staff wearing either the ubiquitous full beard or tattoos and displaying them proudly . that was a bit more than ' would be best described as appeared to look a little grimy but you can forgive that in a busy place guess . down each side there appeared an alcove where waiting staff would prepare desserts , coffee and bills . express have done this for a while and 'd rather have my dessert prepared in the kitchen personally . it 's anyones guess if the kitchen staff are more likely to wash their hands than the waiting staff , but at least they wo n't be handling money as often . chose some 's bread to start with the pate and mushrooms . soft drinks being limited to homemade lemonade and ginger beer or mineral water . daughter opted for the lemonade - which they 'd run out of so ginger beer it was . had a pint of the lager - their only lager burger ( ) with fries ( which were extra ) and went for the pizza ( `` & brisket , slow braised in sauce , , watercress & fresh horseradish '' ) on the recommendation of the waitress over the fish and arrived quickly - ginger beer was lovely , the lager a little too fruity or floral for my taste - it had hints of fry 's turkish delight and notes of potpourri . fine on craft beer night but for some refreshment it was a little too arrived quickly . had the appearance of burned . wedges with a dark thin crust and a white interior with the odd seed for good measure . was actually delicious - for someone who had n't eaten properly all day . was really nice - the crust had a slight and the bread was substantial and slightly chewy . whipped salted butter what was to be served with it - i presume was drizzled over the top - though it seemed more like oil and there was no salt . were provided . very were lovely . was full flavoured with a texture with a toasted slick of thick white cut into soldiers . veg were odd but actually worked mushrooms were very tasty . mayonnaise they were to be served with was drizzled on sparingly . were crisp with a nice texture . smaller pieces having suffered more from the frying experience . starters served with a huge watercress came up soon looked great . looked artisan ; ) asked for some bbq sauce for the burger but was told they do n't stock it as it is meant to be food . pizza is ? quite enjoyed the burger but the bun was dry and uninspiring and left that . chips were astonishingly crisp yet delicate , though slightly lacking in flavour . without the chips her burger would not have been a very substantial meal . slaw ' looked old and dull , nothing about it . tried a little and the veg seemed reasonably fresh but got a big flavour of mint . that 's what they mean by rainbow . 'd had a second taste maybe it would have been blueberry or ? was really good . crust could have been crisper and belied it 's appearance . flavours worked well , an overall meeting well with the red leicester and watercress , only the hint of horseradish unfortunately . guess more of that would n't be to everyones were efficient and friendly . waitress was a polyglot and definitely the cleanest of all the staff we saw . would make me think twice about a dessert is reasonably tight and of course you are only under cover - not actually indoors so expect it would be on cooler evenings - and this would cool your food off faster too . they seem to have heaters and individual floor fan heaters so it may be ok. with the location so near to the spot where people perform can imagine it could be noisy too , on a warm evening is maybe the best time to come ? overall - pretty good , but burger pricey and they think bbq sauce is not while pizza is .",4.0

"decided to try here on a busy night , you can get an idea of what the food looks like as the restaurant is surrounded by large glass panels , we had decided that we wanted a pizza and they looked great as we stood at other diners , they must have felt like they were in a zoo lol ( sorry if you were one of the diners ) it was bitterly cold and as this place is outside we were a little worried that we may freeze to death while eating , no need for any concerns there , as they have large electric heaters on the walls opposite your table , like the ones you get on pub table umbrellas , and they have customer controls on the wall behind you to heat the seat and underneath for your feet , in fact my wife had to take her coat off , our orders where taken quickly and our waiter suggested we have a portion of skinny fries to munch on while we waited for our pizzas , which was a great idea , and they were lovely , now to the pizzas , ordered the pulled pork with chorizo and chilli , the base was heaven as was most of the other ingredients , but suppose you would want it to be great at around , the only problem was it was n't pulled pork it was just fat and gristle , only ate about slices , the waiter came to take the plates and pointed out that could n't eat it as it was just fat , he informed me it was belly pork , well if it is then label it as that not pulled pork ? , anyway fully intended to pay for it but when he arrived with the bill he said he had taken it off , so fair play to him , my wife just had the margarita pizza , but did n't like the fresh tomatoes , philistine ha ha , anyway the bill came to around with a few drinks , so not to bad in as the average price of a pint is , the people from on the table next to us had the fish and chips and declared it a winner , another plus was the fact that it is quite a small place so to have around staff serving and cooking is very good , that is without the staff underneath the restaurant as there was a dumb waiter , all in all we enjoyed our experience and will give it another try on our next visit , thanked the waiter for removing the price of my pizza from the bill and left a descent tip , thanks guys ,",4.0
and were fantastic helping with my son 's birthday party for very excited boys ! were kind and patient and really charming with all the boys and parents . made it very stress free and easy for me . is a great venue for kids ' parties . whole experience was super . all had a really happy day : ) thank you so much to and and the team !,5.0

"play music too loud - the fast , furious stuff proven to make punters eat faster and leave quicker , when in my opinion , it should be a place to share conversations . food still comes out as and when , so one person can be finishing as someone else 's plate arrives . was fun when the chain started - perhaps a whiff of authenticity - but now merely poor ? , although tasty , 'm sure the meat to ratio has now fallen so low , veggies could now eat anything on the menu . think it is time the chain took stock and led on customer satisfaction ahead of customer turnover and margins ?",3.0

"live yds away from the and wish it was just that bit better . would certainly go more often if could just have good meal without has a lot of potential and it 's intentions are fantastic . the food just falls short of the ' image that just about every pub in the country claims to drink is excellent , the bar staff are good and as a pub , the place ticks every box . bar bites are also very good and as a pub you ca n't go wrong ! food is almost always very well presented however it is very average in terms of taste and aside from its presentation and the odd dish is nothing more than average enough pub grub but certainly is n't ' in any respect . food lacks that special something , it 's good enough but you generally feel underwhelmed by of the main waiters ( dark hair ) black t-shirt normally ) in there is a little on the condescending side and if you ask for something ( i.e a jug of water ) it generally wo n't arrive until you have finished . he asked if we enjoyed our meal , you answer ' , however would have preferred my water with my meal you get told that you should have asked him hardly the point . waiting staff walk round very quickly avoiding eye contact . is generally dumped on the table in paper napkins in the centre of the this is cheap and so called the staff wear uniforms or are at least are smartly dressed . in the maynard seem to think that they have earned the right to wear a t-shirt and jeans - fine , but do n't market yourself as upmarket if you are not going to make the tables are usually sticky and often you find yourself in in the middle of the bar area around people drinking - this is the essence of dining in a pub and not so much in a gastropub where there would be some differentiation in seating ; warning customers beforehand might be an could do with some more lunch staff too as they appear to be rushed off their needs to up its game on the restaurant side and add a little bit more finesse and refinement to the service and take a little bit more care with putting some of the items of food together . - overall , the place is average but one to keep an eye on as you might get a really good meal there one day but then be let down the next hence why do n't go anymore . wish them luck with the business and hope that they manage to refine it every so slightly and 'll be back .",3.0

my fellow on trip advisor . prepared to pay but it is well worth the money . making a reservation you need to request a table with a view of view is ordered the ribeye and my wife had the filet . were cooked perfectly . difference compared to the states is the filets are cut like a regular steak and not like the filet cooked in eateries . makes a difference . ribeye was great and went down sides are a little small but after a good steak one does not need a lot of sides . our meal they called us a cab which took a little time but it was not a black cab with no is a once in a lifetime meal .,5.0

"visited this restaurant with teenagers after an afternoon on , thinking it would be a quick hearty meal for were seated quite quickly but then waited minutes for our drinks order to be taken . a further minutes wait for our food , asked the waitress how long it would be . response was `` you did ask for well done steaks , so these take a lot longer '' .

'd just like a bit more garlic with the grilled chicken , but guess maybe better not bring too much standard to avoid problems with most is also efficient ( the only mezze that always takes long is the grilled halloumi , no clue why , but the rest is quick ) and very friendly . when you 're about to finish your meal , they always bring fruits small lebanese the subjective part , as said service is friendly , and you get a warm welcome , and this place makes you feel good while outside it 's drizzly and grey ; - )",5.0

'' we were n't that bothered by the situation , it 's a pub ! we were perplexed by his odd response . what you 're after for a casual afternoon . then waited an hour for a roast that was n't very warm and one dish came without cabbage . we 'd waited so long for the food in the first place we could n't be bothered to ask for it . staff seem to lack the ability to give eye contact , much less be friendly . want to call it an off day - get that lunch services can be stressful - 've done plenty , but reading other comments , it sounds like some more training is needed .",2.0
"very very busy at all times , been a few times for different reasons , but i would say that its key to book and get a table sorted or you will end up waiting for in the food is good and the staff are almost over the top friendly trying to give that american feel ! are many around , so book into one and see what you think . : types of parties welcome , families , friends , dates , friends .",3.0
"had a table booked for the second seating , our table was n't quite ready as the previous customers were just paying , the manager apologised for the delay and offered us a table outside to wait with a complimentary glass of delicous bubbles , this was a lovely touch but not necessary as we were happy to wait . waitress was great in explaining the menu , telling us how many sharing plates to order and helping us a choose a wine from the meal was delicious , with the lardo being the highlight , it was so good we asked for another plate to share and learnt from the waitress that it was made on site . was simply served , thinly sliced with honeyed walnuts . ravioli was also amazing , perfectly made pasta with a unique celeriac filling . such an extensive menu the desert choice was small , however this worked well as we tried one of each and everything was well executed . eating so much it was probably a good thing that we did n't have too much to choose great meal and will be returning and recommending .",5.0

"the other restaurants this place relies on its destination appeal . view is obviously fantastic , and worth the evening in itself . , for the prices charged the food and drink really just does n't live up to expectation . had to ask for water twice and then it came in warm glasses without ice . wine prices were extortionate . duck was superb , as was the chili beef . of the other dishes were much more mediocre than those two , which is a shame . will return to the for a drink in the bar and that view , but not for the food in any of their overpriced restaurants in future .",2.0

"met up with a colleague here to have a more informal meeting . staff were very attentive and very polite , especially considering we took quite a while to really order . have read other reviews saying the staff were very unpleasant , perhaps this is dependent on who is working as have to admit did not get the impression of any hostility ! food was very pleasant we had lamb chops to start which we shared and this was the perfect sharing size . lamb was very good quality , appeared lean , and well seasoned giving it a really good flavor . could not fault mains we had two of the spicier chicken curries , rice and naan . was indifferent about the rice . however the naan was very fresh tasting and the curries had a great flavor , and the curries the perfect level of spice and depth of flavor ! appearance of maybe one curry was initially off putting ( a very dark green ) but am not one to judge a book by its cover or food by its appearance ! would recommend this restaurant as a casual , yet very nice place to eat with friends .",4.0
"'s is unassuming from the street , but you walk in past the samples from their bakery to a busy but accommodating cafe restaurant in lovely exposed brick and light wood surroundings . and intimate atmosphere all at the same time . sat at the bar rather than a table , and found it to be a casual and appropriately informal way to experience the selection of delicious small plates shared among friends made for a fantastic relaxed lunch . food was uniformly good : rabbit skewers , scallops , wonderful sourdough . plate enough for three people to get a decent taste , and or small plates plenty to feed the of us . well looked after by - a true hospitality kiwi gem . goat 's cheese finisher was superb , but the highlight of the day was the organic orange wine . worth a you find yourself at , stop in and treat yourself .

"had high hopes of this place especially as it is often given rave reviews by its customers . my experience was underwhelming . should have read the late review of the place which understand was not flattering whole ambience is of a bistro than an upmarket restaurant - although the the individually folded disposable cotton hand towels in the loos might suggest otherwise . arrived around , to be greeted on opening the door , by a cramped lobby and a steep staircase . left we entered the restaurant and were greeted by someone witht who had understanding to my my mind was not a good start to the evening . were promptly shown to our table which was located against the wall , where the seating space was very cramped . be fair all the tables seemed to be like this ] . seats themselves were basically old bistro style wooden chairs with no arms and were very uncomfortable . small table was also rickety and unstable . were white linen cloths but no flowers or candles . decor of the room itself was a watered down attempt at art , the only notable features being a couple of mirrors attached to some pillars and the dark coloured woodwork . was , but despite the pretty [ some might say tacky ] lights outside , inside the decor was definitely from the scrooge school of art , with the only minimalist decorative feature being a plastic garland which looked like it had been bought at a local store . were no pretty lights , no stars , no candles , no frosted grapes or fruit , no holly , no ivy , no flowers - nada - just one plastic garland draped over at the back of the room . assume this lack of festive decoration was either due to the fact the restaurant is always fully booked , so they feel there is need to bother , or because it regards itself an establishment primarily for the educated `` foodie '' who can be expected to have little interest such tacky things as decor or indeed the visual presentation of the restaurant more generally . perhaps be fair once the restaurant filled up it did n't lack atmosphere , this being provided by the noise and general hubbub of its clientele some of whom seemed to consist people who would like to live near but could not afford to or who perhaps did live in but were tired of their local restaurant choice , and had for the evening to see what a trip out to a starred restaurant bistro near would be like . by the the fact the restaurant was full on a evening they either had had a previously better experience than , or they were inclined to rely too heavily on the views of `` experts '' . service however was good : unpretentious , and swift the waiters seemed to glide effortlessly about the place despite the cramped nature of the establishment . only complaint was that found could not easily understand the accent of our softly spoken server . were presented with a very extensive [ if pricey ] wine list which am sure compares well with other establishments of this quality . as we were driving , only chose a small glass of merlot - this was pleasant but nothing special . partner had a glass of fresh orange juice . [ came with a lump ice despite him not asking for it ] menu here is in style and offers a table experience which was priced at per person [ rather more than expected from their website which suggested a lower price ] . matter , there was a fair choice of dishes and an extensive wine menu . both chose the same dishes am not sure why starter of fish cakes in a creamy chunky soup was well presented and was simply superb . first class . it was all down hill from there . our main course we chose a steak which came with with chunky chips [ this dish was extra per head ] . was , as would be expected for fillet streak and very tender was cooked carefully to our choice , and was well presented on the plate - but the flavour ? a completely different story . my mind it was bland and complete lacking in flavour , [ as was the accompanying jus ] . this was an off day but one wonders why a restaurant of this quality is offering this expensive cut of meat [ which to my mind does n't compare well the flavour of a good ribeye steak ] instead of less less expensive cuts which are known known to have a better flavour . perhaps suggests that the chef here needs to be more discriminating and place greater weight on the flavour of the meat and rather less on a the fancy name of this quite frankly over rated cut . was n't bad , but just was n't good value for money [ remember we paid extra } and it was lacking in flavour . accompanying chips were the saving grace , being both crisp and having an excellent flavour . the meat should have been the star and it was n't - it was just bland . desert was baked . consisted of a grapefruit sorbet covered in meringue accompanied by an assortment of fresh fruit salad . sorbet itself was well flavoured , if perhaps a little tart [ but then again grapefruit is ] , unfortunately it was ruined by the meringue which looked rather prissy being piped with tiny stars it had a curious elastic consistency and an odd and almost unpleasant taste which could n't exactly nail down - however more notably it lacked the requisite sweetness to offset the tart sorbet . for presentation , the dish looked like an individual lemon meringue pie might have bought at or the & frozen food counter . thought it a disappointment despite the elaborate description on the menu . not possessed a star , been somewhat less expensive and less cramped , i might have rated it as four stars the but given the lack of space and comfort , the rickety tables , the unspectacular food and the poor value for money could n't . [ bill came to over for two , even though we only had one small glass of merlot wine and single glass of orange juice and no coffee ] . was just expecting too much and was thus bound to be disappointed . based on my experience , one wonders if there is n't an element of `` '' about the reputation of this place . doubt will be patronising this establishment in the foreseeable future .",3.0

got off to a very promising start but ultimately left slightly underwhelmed . were welcomed enthusiastically and shown to our table . placed drink orders and this is where it went wrong . then took fifteen minutes for the drinks to arrive and this was only after we chased . then they came one at a time and not all together for the three of us dining together . in mind we had booked a table for noon on a so it wasn ’ t massively busy . have to say is that the food was really good . had a tuna carpaccio to start and for my main – both of which were delicious and well presented . ’ s just that the service didn ’ t match up to the food . chap on the table next to us complained about his fish – which he felt was undercooked . message back from the kitchen was that the chef had been shown this and there was nothing wrong with it ! ’ s not the point – if the was unhappy he should have been served the dish again with the fish cooked more to their liking . ’ m giving it a out of – but that ’ s an average of for the food and for the service .,3.0
"dined at in this past while visiting . were a large group of family and friends and we had a splendid time . fish with chips was a huge hit . portions were huge . a combination : great food , great atmosphere , great company , great service and most of all great desserts were amazing . tried spotted dick with a warm custard and it immediately became one of my favorite desserts . sure to check out for the most amazing fish and chips in .",5.0
"have been here a few times and it never disappoints . 's hidden down a side street in an otherwise drab area . food that is always well presented , and the ginger bread ( which you can help yourself to ) is just to die for . time have been this place is over run with yummy mummy 's and their kids , which can make the place a little hectic recommend booking an outdoor area if you can as its lovely out there .",4.0
"went on a night after a generally crappy working week and our visit was a welcome reminder that there are lots of good things in the world too ! food was interesting and amusing and tasty and clever . really recommend this place as a foodie treat , my favourite things from the course tasting menus were the bits that you could just pop into your mouth like the beetroot roll and the crispy smoked cod . every course was brilliant . thought the food was coming a little fast so we asked the staff to slow that down and they did , we thought the dessert wine was and the lovely waiter whisked away our glasses and brought back the most delicious desert wine have ever had . do n't worry if you feel anything is wrong , they will right it - another nice touch was , to be brought out food by the chefs who created it , thought this was a lovely thing . products in the bathroom too , just sayin . , go go .",5.0
"here on a sat lunch before taking my daughter to the theatre . n't complain about the food , a little costly as always think for just a normal burger is a lot and you get no salad or coleslaw with that literally just thr burger and fries plus an extra pound to get sweet potato fries , which do n't understand either as they are n't any more expensive to buy . the food was nice the waiter was rude . took the plates away for the starters while was still eating and literally stood there and watched me finish mine before snatching the plate from under me . break between that and the main either came out virtually straight away . other gripe was the coke refills well because they had filled it with ice to the top it was more like coloured water by the time we finished our coke which did n't take more than a minute as must have been no more than an inch of it with the ice was still full to the brim with ice . joke there must have been cubes in it . obviously doing this to save money well not with me just said no ice for the next one which the waiter seemed annoyed with . did n't complain but had this not been a refill drink would have done as they are trying to rip people off . appeared to be our table aswell , as other people with refills did n't appear to have anywhere near the amount of ice cubes we did . will return as always do but hope the service is better next time !",3.0
"outside of is nothing to write home about , a narrow frontage on the end of a small parade of shops , and the interior is basic with a handful of tables and kitchen at the back , but the food is the star here . chef has been coaxed out of retirement to run things , and the sushi and sashimi are top drawer - , balanced flavours , simply presented , unpretentious and delicious . had the family platter which was plenty enough for three , plus a couple of recommendations including a fried sardine fillet which tasted like it had just left the sea ! in warm and friendly staff and the prices ( for three including drinks , plus complimentary tea ) and there is n't really anything to dislike . is a little gem and well worth a visit .",5.0
"place is cool even if in the basement ; nice rustic tables and chairs make you feel comfortable and have a pound menu for lunch that is interesting and big had tasty and crunchy pork belly squares and fresh oysters , my husband absolutely meaty anchovies and sea bass on a fresh broad bean , green peas and mussel light sauce to die real coffee and kind service .",4.0

"guessed it , gave a visit because 'm a huge fan of . food delivered on taste , just like the recipes 've cooked with at home , but the rest of the as a business left much to be desired .

've read through a few other comments and 've noticed the replying with comments about getting installed , but these replies go back months and still no . on to the customer service . queuing up outside a member of staff came and asked if anyone wanted a table . pointed to the window bar stool seats and said would sit there . paying for my food and going to sit at one of the bar stools , a member of staff told me that could not sit there as these were reserved tables . explained that told the other member of staff wanted to sit in , but she just said sorry and walked away . was then stood in the middle of the crowded deli with a plate full of food and no place to sit . then had to wade my way back through all the people to ask for a takeaway box . person behind the counter happily obliged and transferred my food into a plastic the last thing 'd like to talk about is the prices . it was about for tablespoons full of food , really not much at all . did n't dare go for a dessert or drink and was a bit worried about how much the total bill would be ! extra item , like a dollop of hummus was about extra so quickly adds up . often make some of 's recipes at home , even using organic ingredients and sourcing local produce , know how much the food costs to make , so know that the prices are simply obscene . in all , very in terms of the food but in terms of the business and running of the place it is truly terrible .",2.0

"came here on the for a friend 's birthday and notice it 's on the as well . sure if the food was unlucky on that day ! arrived at for our table , which was booked for around people , greeted nicely by the waiters were generally friendly and polite , they were n't rude or stuck up . it 's a shame have to give them for the service as mostly the majority of it was a wait esp . the cocktails , which were sitting on the counter for some time . waiter asked me and some others if they wanted to pay for their cocktails now and we said yes , but he never did . orders were really confusing , we did n't pick the food ourselves , guessing our friend who booked it made the orders already or the person on the phone helped , yet there were some extras that came out so it was quite a waste and more money on the table ! would 've ate it , but some of the foods did n't look 'm not sure what saw in pictures as the uniforms looked different on photos , but think it would 've felt more like a dining experience if the waiters wore a more proper uniform when serving customers as they look more casual then serving with people 's food was average , it was n't luxury or that special . had a & for starter and for the main and the portions were really small . friend had king prawns in hers and some others who had them did n't , so was quite confuzzled as if the chef just put leftovers in the food . food would 've been better seasoned , such as the which is suppose to be salty , but the sides that came with it did n't the dish . the pasta dish was nice , there was n't much flavours or seafood in the dish and was quite shock for the price for it as well . waiters brought us one bread each from a basket with a big gunk of butter on the plate while most fine dining restaurants they would 've prepared them on the table before we arrived , in a basket as writing this review was curious about the menu prices , since we already got chosen our food before we arrived and could n't believe the was ! small dish was not enough to fill me up it was half the size of the plate . understand it 's a fine dining experience , but not the value or quality of the food was worth the money have to be honest . the cocktail drinks were good value anyway ! would 've tried the desserts , but we did n't have the time to stay as we were already late to meet our limo driver parked really love the atmosphere of the place esp . in the night time where you can get a perfect view of the millennium eye . most atmosphere got from it all was the pianist who made a good impression to everyone and was also a good laugh ! whole interior was nice and not too shabby , which felt great to be in . location was good and not too far from the station ! overall feel to the place is warm and welcoming , but shame about the service and food it would 've made a better experience . only hear my friends complaining the rest of the evening with the food and waiting as well our mains did n't come on time when the limo was already waiting for us so there was a bit of a panic with the birthday girl . 'm not sure would come back although the waiters were good to us all this time , but definitely sure wo n't come back for the food . 've experienced more better fine dining restaurants in with their theatre menus and even ! are lot 's to choose in so even though it 's on a boat , there is no need to pay extra for the scenery ( unless it 's something occasionally special ) , it 's all about the experience with food that is memorable to you .",3.0
"and fast . miso soup is really good but all of the not wraps taste the same . , falafel - whatever .",3.0

"do n't usually do chains . , now have a great gluten free offering and my wife is celiac , so always looking for good options . for both and non is good , a few interesting touches ( berry crumble is outstanding ) . the service from the team there was helped with our stroller , gave us a toddler friendly table and had pencils and paper on the table by the time we were sat served us quickly and engaged with our to make her experience and well done team .",5.0
"are two simple reasons to go . of all , pies are great ! never find pies as good as those couse are very masterpieces becouse of the pastry , the meat , sauces , everything ! then , because the owner is fantastic . likes his job and it shows , kind and very funny !

across this charming pub on the bank holiday weekend . decor was gorgeous . was served by a wonderful man named ( believe he was the manager ) who was extremely great selection of wines in a fun and relaxed atmosphere . definite place to visit if you are ever in the area .,5.0
would never venture into without a stop at this place but best to make reservations well in advance . is one of their best offerings and the service is perfect .,5.0
"popped in for a quick beer whilst staying at the nearby . staff gave a friendly welcome and the real ales were varied and well it looks busy as you walk by , note that the much of the seating is out the back behind the bar in the style of a garden courtyard . worth a visit .",4.0
"restaurant is part of a chain , offering mainly dishes . range of choice is impressive , and service is fast and pleasant . one downside is that when it is crowded , the noise is extreme . wrong with people having a good time , but the walls and ceiling are bare , and do nothing to muffle the sound . tables with only paper mats do n't help dim the racket . to have a conversation without needing to shout , but when everyone shouts the noise gets even worse .",3.0
"here for lunch on . had planned this for a while and had several places on our shortlist and went for this one as it ticked all the boxes . adviser rarely lets me down so we thought this was a good bet . was only two other tables occupied for the time we were there and overheard what think was a regular diner asking whether was in and got the impression he was not . might explain why the food was not as good as we had anticipated . it is not that it was bad it was just ok - so nothing to complain about but when you expect something special and do n't get it you feel let down ! we arrived at midday the chef was to be seen smoking outside of the restaurant - never a good look . lady who served us was very nice , unfortunately the food was not ! very let down , we were so looking forward to this and ruled out several other restaurants that wish we had chosen instead .",3.0
"was very excited to go to this bar , and was supremely thrilled as i sat down in the train at the menu , prices for cocktails was just excessive . menus printed as newspaper , whilst fun , were out of date . asked for the wine and was told the prices were more than advertised . me if 'm wrong , but i do n't think this is actually allowed ? ! were given minutes , as people had booked seats . ( we could n't help but think this was a created urgency to keep a queue at the door ) the bill we all paid our dues , some paying over to cover some of the `` discretionary service charge . '' waitress returned and said we had n't paid enough . we just paid up the extra or so , but afterwards upon checking what we all paid against the receipt , soon realised she had actually returned to collect the `` discretionary '' extra money . we had already paid over the odds prices , this was sadly very disappointing .",3.0
"friend was late and was feeling very hungry . original thought was to go to but it 's another yards away from the office . is my first visit for a couple of years and to be honest the last time was with my lawyer and not really thinking about the did n't start well . knew that there would be a table free at and had n't bothered to book . of house asked we had booked and when said no she asked for my name . she needed to know my name if had n't booked is beyond me . someone in the organisation could enlighten took us upstairs to a half empty restaurant an sat us at a pleasant enough table . was set with decorative glass plates which were then taken away . were repeated inquiries about what we were going to drink , beyond the necessary , when my companion said he would just be happy with sparkling water . fuss and interruption continued through the meal despite protestations that we were happy pouring our own water . waiters also seem to lack any idea of which side to serve from and and which to take food was dull . very dull . dull to be honest and the three stars have given this place is probably one to used to be a good chef . gather he 's opened a few spin offs in and other sand pits where the money speaks louder than it should . should take heed . are many good restaurants in the area and after this very poor meal and frankly bad service can think of no occasion to should have let my brain take control and walked the extra yards round to than listen to my grumbling stomach .",3.0
"was good , usual offering . know what you get with , well cooked food and priced reasonably .",4.0
"this wonderful . a weekend trip to my sister and had stopped to check out the menu and thought it would be a great place to we met up with our brother and sister in law ( they live in ) after a trip on the our sister in law informed us we were booked on the good ship for ( ) fabulous staff they looked after us so well . , , and was gorgeous had the duck starter . main and shortbread dessert a must if your visiting my sister in law booked via so was a great deal too .",4.0
"ate here using a discount voucher ( never used one before ) so were a little unsure what we might need n't of worried , the food was fantastic , the staff were attentive , responsive and both polite and voucher made this a real bargin but to be honest even full price it would have been worth it . wife fell in love with the and would gladly go back just to eat that again ! great restaurant in a great location serving really great food the whole deal in hope we get to go back again and 'd highly recommend them to anyone whether your looking for a general meal or a romantic dinner for two it 's well worth a visit .",5.0

"'m always looking for a local restaurant that will tick all the boxes . , the , a institution , did n't do that . 's a nice enough place tucked away in narrow 's off with decent sized tables , welcoming waiters and a nice buzzy atmosphere . came promptly but the portion control was out of control ; they were simply too big . hot sardine starter was tasty , my wife 's was good but there was far too much on the plate very off putting ! had whole seabass in olive oil , rosemary and lemon sauce with sauteed potatoes and fried courgette `` chips '' . was nicely , tasted good although the sauce was a bit too lemony for my liking . wife 's calf 's liver was pink but not as soft as it could be and the portion again was too large . 'm disappointed that the management thinks it necessary to charge for side dishes . adds for side dishes or extra to the bill if you 're paying for meal , including service and two half bottles of wine , plus an extra glass of wine and two coffees came to ( no desserts ) . think that 's just too expensive in what is basically a decent quality but straight local restaurant ; it 's just too much money to go there on a regular basis . to give some sort of comparison , dined the previous day ( party of four also ) at , 's one star in . had the set lunch ( choice of items per course ) , all three courses plus bottle of decent house wine and three glasses of prosecco for exactly the same price , .",3.0
"have been to times so far and have to say that love it ! have been there only in or so have only seen the restaurant with christmas decorations . is decorated in the most elegant way have ever food is amazing and the service very good . got a crab salad with curry mayo as a starter and it was divine . partner got the beetroot salad as a starter and it was very good as well . a main , my partner got the fish pie and have to say that this was the best fish pie have ever eaten . yummy ! got the steak with sauce and chips and loved it ! sides we got parsnips and boiled spinach . then got the rum baba and it was amazing as got one bottle of sparkling water and of red wine and the bill was around criticisms are the ) side dishes are extremely ) of the dishes / sauces have garlic and onions , so felt a bit restricted in my options , as everything was already marinated or the sauces were already prepared . was no flexibility to accommodate any special dietary ) really fancied eating pheasant or beef with puddings , but these two dishes are only made for two people . partner is ( vegetarian who eats fish ) , so could n't have it . waiter suggested that have the double portion on my own , but obviously charge me double . that was a bit of a let down for the restaurant is amazing , very posh and it is worth visiting .",5.0
"food is tasty and often refreshingly different but have noticed a trend of some waiters displaying an alarming lack of self assurance , knowledge and customer care - regarding the menu , listening skills and the expectations of guests . everyone who visits the restaurant is a tourist who may never come back !",3.0
"took two friends to tea here recently . booking tool on the cafe 's website was not working , so phoned my reservation . arrived , my reservation had not been recorded . atmosphere in the cafe was quite pleasant , though the surrounding area of the gallery can get hectic at times . food and beverages at teatime were adequate though not outstanding . was uneven : we were served by one charming waitress , and one waiter who was offhand . typically mediocre venue , in other words .",3.0
"is a typical old , for tourists to get a experience , were made welcome and served very quickly , the pub was very busy . had shorts and personally were not to our taste , however they were very cheap compared to other establishments nearby , personally think this would be more of a barrel a bitter pub as it is obviously linked to the brewery . would visit again , but possibly try the cask beers , toilets were clean and food looked good",3.0
", the only way to describe , we went to and the restaurant was empty and now know why , we were told to wait at the bar ! waited at the bar and the bartender was just ignorant .

"a great meal here with a small group , the restaurant is laid back and fun , the menu ticked all the boxes , the food tasted freshly prepared , no grease and no . wine menu is short but well formed . owner was a real gentleman . only negative is theat the lighting is a bit bright . a very good local .",4.0
"dish approx will make you happy . specialise only in noodles , take no reservations and long queues usually form along the sidewalk from around . why is it so good ? it ’ s blissfully the choice of only main ramen dishes ( and several tasty such as ) they have removed the dilemma and paradox of choice which often leaves me paralysed at other of the burden of having to choose what to eat , can concentrate on simply enjoying an authentic experience of freshly made ramen , a dish which is eaten all throughout and is essentially a noodle soup made with the stock from pork , chicken and sometimes also fish . ’ s a comforting dish perfect for autumn and winter , but can be eaten all year round . have taken their name from the style of ramen popular in ’ s south island , interior is a fusion of modern with natural timbers and elements of traditional culture . atmosphere is hip and casual , the staff are warm and and the price is have made it onto my personal favourites list and will be lining up again soon for some ramen .",5.0

came here for dinner after a lovely day out in . is beautifully located right on the and has a nice outdoor seating area . staff took a long time to take our order but it was quite busy and everyone was very pleasant . food and drink is on the pricey side for what you get but was enough to fill us up and we had the new chicken burger which tasted good . definitely go back again if was in the area .,4.0
"visiting friends in , we were able to walk to this wonderful little restaurant . dined in but they do have a separate `` to go '' portion of the restaurant that is around the corner from the main restaurant . was great , nice wine list . was fresh and plentiful . prices are a bit higher but worth it for the quality of food . on the fish was light . all had fish and chips but ordered different fish . had the salmon and it was very good and would order again . atmosphere with beautiful artwork on the walls and the beautiful aquarium .",4.0

looking forward to our first visit to one of 's restaurants whilst we were in the as absolutely love his recipes . were however left a bit disappointed with our dinner as ' pizza was only average and my daughter 's chicken that she ordered was overcooked and dry : ( was a lovely atmosphere there but not quite good enough to cover the disappointment of the food : (,3.0
"was going to give stars but have given , because they can do much better at this , the product is inconsistent , during periods when the place is not busy the pizzas can be ok , but if it is busy the quality dwindle rapidly . they burnt and they have to be redone . oil tasted old or too spicy . ok pizza but nothing like a real .",2.0
"friend and had a voucher for & so booked an early table for a catch up on a evening . arrived a little early so had a glass of wine at the bar while waited , which was very reasonably priced for a restaurant this area of . we were shown to our table we remembered we 'd forgotten to mention my friend 's allergy to fungi ( would normally bring this to a restaurant 's attention when booking ) , which made one of the dishes on the set menu unsuitable for her . were told , following a consultation with the chef , that we would need to give hours notice to change a dish in the menu and so would need to skip that course rather than replace it with something . were initially quite surprised that there was no way to adapt it or that there was n't anything else on their menu they could substitute it for as other restaurants have always been very accommodating on this front . have no doubt that it was as they said and was n't possible , it 's just not something we 've ever been told before . said , we soon forgot all about it when our waiter kindly bought us a complimentary glass of champagne each to make up for it ! top of which we were also given a small glass of a particularly nice white wine that our waiter had been telling us about , also on the house . thought that was a nice gesture to replace the missing dish and it more than made up for any disappointment . remaining courses on the set menu were absolutely delicious , especially the pork belly . flavours . , after a first visit to the restaurant with a voucher , would happily go back without one .",5.0

went to this restaurant with high expectations only to find that the staff were not up to the job and the food was very mediocre but the bill was very high . waiting staff had no idea how to serve wine and that was having had to wait some time for the drinks order to be taken . food was not up to the standard you would expect and was very embarrassed to be taking friends there . will not be returning to this restaurant .,2.0

"have to start this review by stating that never actually managed to eat here ; only pre-dinner drinks . came here for an end of week night treat for my kids and their friend . restaurant inside looked lovely and we ordered pizzas fairly quickly . was not keeping an eye on the time , and despite numerous asks , the food had not arrived after an hour ( it ’ s just a pizzeria ! ! ! ) . is the first time , and hopefully the last , have walked out of a restaurant before the food arrived . did slowly realise that the problem was that the pizzeria had received a large takeaway order and had prioritised that over the other customers . accept this can happen , it ’ s a business and the kitchen sometimes can not cope . , what is totally unacceptable is the service we received , they did not tell us once that the food would be so delayed and the kitchen was struggling or offer us anything as simple as bread in the meantime . they did find it in their heart to take my money for the drinks and on reflection , don ’ t think actually got an apology ! was a night treat for the kid and that is probably the most disappointing thing for me . have lived in the area for years and this street has several independent restaurants where you get lovely personal service ; unfortunately seems to be the exception .",1.0
boyfriend and visited for a mid week dinner . in a backstreet off it is quite a surprise to find an restaurant here . the decor was delightful and totally appropriate for an restaurant of this quality . seeing the tasting menu we opted for that despite the price . were not disappointed with the quality of food and the efficient service . tandoori salmon and foie gras were both favourites of mine . the restaurant did n't have the matched wines for the tasting menu but the sommelier was able to provide some great advice on what we could have that would work . knowledge of the wines was impressive and what would expect in a restaurant of this standard . in all a lovely dinner .,4.0

"the food , venue and service are to be recommended , the eat free ' policy is certainly not . against well behaved children in a restaurant but little people jumping over the banquets and screaming at the top of their voices does not add to the experience , especially considering 'm paying the same price for the pleasure as those parents who can obviously not control their offspring . you 're a kindergarten teacher on a day off or equipped with a personality consider this place .",1.0
"had an early dinner at before heading to a concert . we had heard a lot about it and feared it was more tourist trap than a good dining venue , we could n't have been more wrong . were given a lovely table near the bar , but with a view to both front and back of the main dining room on the ground floor . staff could not have been more and attentive . food was about as good a meal as can remember -- perhaps better ! starters of lobster bisque and smoked salmon were just right , and the mains of grilled loin of venison and scallops with braised pork cheeks were both simply heavenly . neither meal came with any `` sides '' or potato , we ordered a mashed potato side to share . portions were generous , but not overwhelming -- which left room for apple and blackberry crumble with custard went down very well as did the with decadent chocolate brownie . had both cider and a couple of beers , and the bill came to just a little over . do add a discretionary charge ( gratuity ) of % , but do make a point of saying it is entirely voluntary . thought it was worth every penny and left feeling very satisfied .",5.0

"daughter and were visiting for two days and were looking for somewhere to have lunch on our final day . had already walked out of one restaurant where we had tried to order our food the way we like it and were told we had to have it how it came as it was pre-made . as we were walking near it started to rain so we ran inside without even looking at the menu . can not compliment our waiter , , highly enough . came over to take our order but the menu was so vast we could not make up our minds so he took our drinks order then came back and offered us advice on the food . both liked the sound of the creamy pasta but do n't like peppers and my daughter does n't like tomatoes so he said , no problem , he would order one without peppers and one without tomatoes . we did n't know which size to order and he suggested two smaller portions with garlic bread as a side order . the meals came , they were perfect and just the right amount . the meal my daughter finished the lemonade she had ordered and before she put the empty glass down on the table arrived with another ( we had n't even realised it was a bottomless drink when we ordered it ) we were eating our meal was looking out of the window when saw dash across the road . was an elderly lady in a wheelchair trying to purchase something from across the road and she could not get in because there were two high steps up to the entrance . saw ask the lady what she wanted and he went in and ordered for her . a lovely thing to we asked for our bill , asked us where we were going next . said we were just passing time until it was time to catch our train and we had already been everywhere we had wanted to go . pulled up a chair and told us lots of places to visit which we had either never heard of or had not considered going to . told us about a secret bar , set in the , in an old train station and we decided to go there . was an absolutely amazing experience from start to finish and was the icing on the cake for our visit to . would never ever have heard about this bar if had not told us . daughter enjoyed herself so much she wanted to go back and thank him but , unfortunately , we did not have time before our train to we had a lovely meal , fantastic service and a great recommendation leading to a unique evening where we went back in time and next time we are in , will definitely be on our schedule again along with some of the other recommendations gave us . you .",5.0

"'m not much of a fish lover but do eat fish on occasions . this place felt like a fish lover and after trying oysters over a year ago could n't resist . ordering a half dozen at the bar was reunited with my love for oysters but could n't remember the way to eat them . chef overheard this conversation and started to make recommendations to us . also included a free sample of some of the oysters ( the most expensive on the menu ) so that we could taste a different kind . ! fish pie was really nice and so was the dessert ( coffee profiteroles ) . a couple of points - tomato side seemed a bit basic . - sneaky donation was added to my bill to a hunger charity . cause maybe but when you already pay a good monthly donation to a charity feel this was a bit cheeky . - finally , a % service charge . seems that we 're following in the footsteps of by paying a service charge everywhere now . if remember correctly , waiters and chefs in are on a much lower salary as part of their salary comes from tips . in ca n't imagine they would even be near min wage which denotes that service charge is a great bonus to their pay . this to the bill makes me feel awkward to have it removed if feel the service was standard or just good which think is the min standard a customer should expect . guess ended up paying for those free oysters ; )",5.0

"visited as part of an xmas trip to . a curry lover was excited to eat star quality food . were greeted at the reception area by about ladies all repeating namaste and bowing . n't know who to say hello to ! ! was an extremely polite welcome . bar area was quite nice - would n't visit just for a drink as there 's no real atmosphere but was fine for pre dinner drink . found the menu disappointing with more fish dishes than anything else . do n't eat fish so unfortunately was immediately limited on choice . had a one course meal ( mainly because did n't fancy any of the starters ) with a bottle of wine , beers and a cocktail . bill was . steep think . partner had venison and enjoyed it very much . loved it . had tandoori chicken , rice , potatoes and naan . very average in my opinion considering the price . chicken was a tad dry but nicely flavoured . staff are very attentive , extremely polite and will give way to you even if they are carrying the large serving trays . even felt bad sometimes as wanted to be polite and let them pass . treat you with huge respect . too quick to top up your glass but otherwise very polite and attentive . in all it was a nice meal ( partner would say excellent ) but we agreed it was probably overpriced . staff are probably the most polite & subservient 've ever come across which must be a huge part of their as al follow the same practices . had an ok meal would n't return as 've had and am sure there are better around for a lot less money .",3.0
finding out there was no food at the and next door we opted to come here . is a little slow as the waiter told us that tables were not allocated to particular waiters which is strange and the place seems understaffed . the was fine was good my guest liked it . said it was a little salty . penne pomodoro was strangely bland . would have liked more of a tomato hit and a bit more garlic . hey ate it all . decent enough grub to warrent stars . was too .,4.0
in here on a evening in a half full restaurant . to table by young woman who was disinterested . seated us at what was possibly the worste table in the room in the middle of the room along a corridor through the restaurant . did say anything to us just plopped the menus on the table . were out for a special occasion and just looked at each other and left . out is not just about the food but also the service . a restaurant does not care about giving us the best table it can it wo n't care about the food . left without any of the or staff near the front door even trying to find out what was wrong owned this business would want to know .,1.0
"walked into the and standing there waiting to be seated for a few minutes the manager eventually stood up from the table he was sat at with friends and showed us to a table , it was fairly busy so this was forgivable however the rest of the meal was not ! starters we went for and breaded . crab cakes were poor , clearly microwaved as they were rubbery but the sauce wasn ’ t a bad flavour so they were acceptable but only just . breaded cheese served in a black cherry sauce was however terrible , the sauce was tasteless but then you don ’ t get much flavour from warmed fruit in a jar . cheese was greasy and again was a poor quality mains we had a fillet steak with chips and salad and supreme with sautéed potatoes and mushrooms . to be fair to the restaurant the fillet steak was cooked well , asked for it blue and that was how it arrived so no complaints with the cooking of the meat . salad however was freezing cold ? ! was actually impressed they could manage to get vegetables that cold without them simply arriving on ice , needless to say ice cold vegetables have little flavour and the dried herbs chucked on top were over powering . chips were reasonable though chicken supreme was very poor , the sautéed potatoes were drenched in grease , the mushrooms drenched in grease and the chicken well over cooked . started to mop the grease up with the napkins but after filling two napkins up with grease we got bored of that and gave of the above would have forgiven if our complaints would have been dealt with in a professional way . waitress upon clearing the starters did not ask if everything was ok and simply snatched the plates and sprinted back to the kitchen . did complain when she came back to clear the mains and simply got a shrug of the shoulders as again she went back to the sanctuary of the kitchen . manager having obviously heard our complaints asked the waitress loudly and rudely within metres of our table `` what ’ s his problem ! '' was the final straw asked for the bill as just wanted to get out of the place , upon presentation of the bill was told the cheese starter had been deducted from the did not want a free meal simply wanted a nice restaurant in which to spend the final evening of our break in and what actually received was poor food at high prices ( in terms of the quality of food ) poor service and a restaurant whose idea of complaints management is to deduct a few quid of off my do yourself a favour and dont eat here , just wished we had checked trip advisor before visiting .",1.0
"here today whilst shopping in . went to the one in a year ago , so knew that the standard should be good and was glad it did not disappoint . , this one is self service - but from the start of the queue to receiving the pizza took less than minutes . came to for pizzas and soft drinks - bargain ! food court had a lot of tables . had the ham with ricotta and wild mushrooms - the sourdough base and toppings were gorgeous ! friend had the tomato , garlic , oregano , capers and anchovies pizza - his favourite and essentially the basis of puttanesca on a read other reviews think they are down to personal taste . hate places like because the base is and too ' . the pizzas are freshly done to order ( you can see them ! ) and put in a wood fired oven to give an authentic flavour . bonus is that despite this , the price is still cheaper ! would n't go here especially because at the end of the day it in a food court of a shopping centre , but when 'm there in the future it sure beats most other options ,",4.0

've been here about times and this hands down the best cocktails 've had in . is so appealing about this place is that the hostess and bar staff really care about making this the best experience possible for you . cocktails are incredibly creative and they will happily have a discussion about your preferences to find something right for you . decor is dark and candle lit which is very conducive to enjoying fine cocktails and good conversation . thing to bear in mind is that its not a big bar and if you do n't book there is a good chance you wo n't get a table especially if its on a to night .,5.0

"have dined here many times over the years but never reviewed it . little has changed over this time except the portions of steak and kidney pie , steamed meat pudding and puddings have reduced considerably but appreciate our eating habits and level of consumption have changed too . restaurant is like stepping back to a more elegant bygone age with a sumptuous stately mansion feel . got there early so we were shown to the bar upstairs . 's relaxed and the bar manager was a top guy . knew how to mix a cocktail alright ! display of bottles and his friendly chat was a joy . snacks on the bar are tasty and the savoury flavours added to the nuts are made by themselves were really great and helped the drinks go down ! the staff are dressed immaculately in white shirts and aprons with black jackets and bow ties . service was immaculate and with a ordered crab salad to start with avocado and crisp wafers which was excellent . main course we shared rib of beef . was cooked to perfection with roasted shallots , spinach and puddings , all presented with the bone in a large copper dish to the table . asked specially for creamed cabbage as a side dish which also came with potatoes . stunning ! dessert was apple tarte tatin which was disappointing as it looked more like a pudding and not thinly based on light pastry but tasty of this was washed down with a bottle of and which were whole meal was not cheap but pure class costs , and totally great this restaurant continue for many years more in exactly the same way as it is unique and very special . love it and can not recommend it highly just wish that diners would show more respect for the staff and not turn up in jeans with untucked shirts . would n't let them in ! ! !",5.0

"discovered the restaurant whilst was having an afternoon tea at . in , near in . was a number of diners whilst we were in the venue which shows a good sign . chose the piece selection known as the which involves a selection of seasonal dishes . menu is seasonal so depending on when you visit , the dishes is likely to vary . bento box involves a variety of cooked beef dishes , served with barley and edamame rice and a soup of kombo dashi , cabbage , sesame , chives , corn and onion . looks very simple and the taste is lighten than the typical soup you get . also ordered the , which included breaded beef fillet , served on a bed of barley and edamame rice . is accompanied by nori , spring onion and fresh wasabi along with beef stock for making . is also served with the dashi soup . the dishes looked very small in portion size , it is filling . was recommended by the staff to enjoy the lighter dishes such as the tofu and sashimi before the beef dishes as it is more heavier and we would be too full to finish should it went the other way . with tasted very simple , the egg omelette with a piece of roe on top wasn ’ t anything spectacular to begin with . was followed by the in home-made tartar sauce with kumquat which introduced some flavour to my taste buds . marinated in wasabi and soy sauce was a little heavy , haven ’ t been much of a fried salmon fan for some time but it was slightly saltier than expected . having some of the and cleansed my taste pallet slightly before moving onto the with and . was a tasty dish and it certainly tasted fresh ( have had the unfortunate of tasting ‘ ’ fish before so have been more cautious about it ever since ) . same goes for the and , both were fresh and delicate in taste . with rosemary and white onion in sauce started to taste a little heavy and this was the dish . couldn ’ t taste the rosemary as much as had anticipated , however the was tasty and the texture was just right . in sauce and garnished in chive reminded me a little of ‘ ’ in many venues . dish was very pleasant and delicious as a break before the next three dishes . with vegetables and roll was a very complex tasting dish . roll was covered in hints of tempura batter whilst the vegetables inside kept it ’ s sweetness at the same dish consisted of beef with chilli and spring onion . can ’ t see much of the heavily marbled pattern on the beef unfortunately , however do enjoy the use of chilli and spring onion . last dish was the beef with chives and yuzu zest garnish . was tasty but heavy . appreciate a good beef but due to the previous dishes , started to feel very full . use of yuzu zest brings my appetite back and enjoyed the dish very much but you must appreciate the fact that there was a bowl of barley and edamame rice and a kombo dashi soup to go along the bento box . was also served with the same barley and edamame rice and the kombo dashi soup . does look simpler and also very bland , however the beef fillet was breaded and then fried . tasted better than the other ‘ katsu ’ dishes you have in other venues and this is not the reason because it was beef , in fact it is because the fillet was breaded generously and equally , and did not find a part where it tasted ‘ ’ and a part where it was ‘ heavily breaded ’ were served by a waiter – he did appear to be more like a manager , was very passionate with the dishes and our dining experience . explained dishes and introduction made us felt very welcomes . only dined at for lunch , therefore will suggest a dinner reservation to experience more of the beef selection .",5.0

"pub itself is very nice and the service is good but the food was . ordered a chicken roast dinner ( a safe choice thought ) , what came out was an anemic looking plate of undercooked chicken and roast potatoes , mushy overcooked vegetables , soaked in copious amounts of watery gravy . friend ordered a burger which looked average at best , she had to send her chips back as they were n't cooked . overpriced , would expect more from a ! would not recommend this place to anyone and will not be eating here again .",2.0

"'d wanted to eat here for a while as from outside it looks lovely , but it was a real disappointment . food was great but the service was awful ; on arrival was treated as an inconvenience , they were n't sure they had my booking ca n't decide if it 's a bar or restaurant , the music was so loud it was difficult to talk ; asked for a quieter table as was with a pregnant friend but that never despite asking staff . were left for mins without being offered drinks ; the food took ages to come ; the waiter did n't know what he was bringing . all this at pretty high prices - for fish cakes . wo n't be going back .",1.0
"here is good - all ingredients on the menu , and though it is pricey , the menus are clearly on display - so if you think it is too expensive do n't go in ( and what else do you expect of ? ! ) myself and my partner had pizzas - both were good , bit stingy on the toppings , but the bases were very good and thin - what let the place down was the poor service - staff were abrupt and slow to bring anything that was asked for - they seem to want to just get you in and out as quickly as possible , and we were seated in a narrow channel , where staff and customers were often squeezing past .",3.0
was a great choice for lunch - so much history must reside within the walls and although it must have changed significantly it seemed to retain a great character . booked in advance for a late lunch so there were not so many customers just had a main course and desert and the food was really very good - a lot of classic dishes executed complaint was the hour wait to be served . price all things considered .,4.0

"old fashioned stylish atmosphere . food was ok but they charge for everything on your plate so it all ends up pretty expensive for medium quality old style food . wine prices are around three times the bottle store prices so it is a rip off . service was fine , not extraordinary but ok . a very very old place must help a lot because if you launched an operation like today doubt if you would succeed , there are just too many great restaurant around making tastier more adventurous cheaper food with cheaper wine .",3.0

"the `` cow pie '' ( ) and a pint of bitter ( ) for a late lunch . menue with about main choices ranging from about for a fish soup to venue is a redundant old pub which has been furnished in minimalist style with what looks like old chairs rescued from skips . pie was `` home made '' and came in an individual dish but vegetables and chips are not included in the price . pie itself was grossly and , after the first mouthful , was not enjoyable . did n't want to make a fuss and struggled to finish it but suffered with unrelenting thirst and reflux for the rest of the day . not go back even if the food was correctly priced at about half of what is actually charged .",2.0

to the extent you would walk past it in and go to the more obvious noodle shop on the corner . you do you will miss a rare treat . friendly smiling welcome you are guided to a basic room but the first thing you notice is the place is full of diners and people from the far east from young boys to the more mature . food is authentically fast and the pork dumplings were delicious . sushi to follow were fresh and very very n't expect linen table wear but do expect good hearty ramen and fresh sushi delivered with a was a baking degrees outside in the city and the paddles they handed out as we left were very welcome !,4.0
"research behind each cocktail is attentive and : the selection and mix of the ingredients make them almost bar scene akin to the speakeasy ones is really of the cocktails is quite basic - but helps having a good trade-off between quality and do n't know what to say about the service : they had a quite straightforward approach , yet not rude , and tried to be helpful proposing valid alternatives in case one were not happy with one of the choices in the menu , but sometimes had the impression they were a bit in all , it is a place where will gladly drink again more than once .",4.0

"around and currently owned by the trust , is one of the oldest inns in and situated close to . bags of atmosphere and close to the walkway this pub is highly popular with tourists and locals a like with multiple rooms to drink and dine with the addition of a large external courtyard area , offers a good selection of gins and ales and a reasonable menu of pub grub if needed .",4.0
"the for a treat , arrived early and had a drink in the warm bar before collecting our thermal capes for the bar itself is very small and holds around people , very well designed with ice tables and ice sculptures dotted around . we were in no rush to join the queue to collect our capes we were at the back of the bunch and had a bit of a wait to get our inclusive cocktail , but once received we were able find a plot and enjoy the cold experience . was a good mix of drinks served in your very own ice glass , the glass is very hard to hold unless you are wearing the inclusive gloves , very tasty indeed . did not purchase any extra drinks since we had some refill vouchers from others who had not attended our party booking , but be aware if you loose your glass you will pay an extra on top of the price of the drinks refill for a new in all a very good experience , and one that would recommend . you can imagine it is extremely cold inside so dress appropriately , the cape itself only really covers to your knees . staff , easy experience and one that would repeat .",4.0
"regularly visited since moved to , this has easily become my favourite local ( if not overall ) restaurant . food is consistently good and the range of flavours they use is impressive so do n't get bored of the food even though go there so regularly . service is also very good - not intrusive but always there when you want them , and take our often silly behaviour well and if you go there for a special occasion they usually give you a little something extra . more could you want ?",5.0
"is the worst ever restaurant have ordered and eaten from . ordered , as take away , beef rendang ( ) , katsu curry ( ) and pak choy with oyster sause ( ) beef rendang turned out to be only thick coconut gravy with what seemed to be a spoonful of the remains of a chunk of brisket ; the katsu , instead of a chicken breast cutlet , were slithers of chicken skin and ; and the pak choy dish comprised only two miserable stalks of the vegetable that was completely overcooked . rice was was dry and stale . have never been more appalled that a kitchen , or any for that matter , has the audacity to serve their customer the food the way and manner in which they did diner should be insulted this way . is an absolute disgrace and we shall never dine at any again .",1.0

went to the same comedy night and had a great time . was no racism at all ( as suggested incorrectly below ) . group of obnoxiously loud people at the back spoiled it at the beginning by constantly talking but eventually asked to leave and it was a great night . 'd thoroughly recommend it .,5.0
"on near station , this restaurant is a poor attempt to copy & and at barely a cheaper price ! tried the signature “ ” , don ’ t know why , think was taken by the thought of having both a burger and some , the combination of the two didn ’ t work for me at all . waste of lobster meat , which is overpowered by the slightly burnt bacon and drowned in friends “ half lobster on its own ” was apparently quite nice although don ’ t be too liberal with the sauce , looked like it had split and was just too greasy . the bright side , it was filling if nothing else .",3.0

"went here based on trip advisor reviews and it was well worth travelling across to it for a 's meal with a difference . frills , no menu but top class food . the owner talked us through his menu twice and you knew instantly what you wanted . need to spend ages reading an uninspiring menu . explained in detail what everything was and what to expect . though the pies were the cheaper options on the menu he insists you try those on your first visit . about how food and with good reason . foods that good he knows you will return for another visit . of the price the food was first rate . fact it was cheap is a real bonus . to plenty of attractions its in the perfect spot to spend the rest of the afternoon visiting the market , museums before getting the boat back west to more touristy areas . food , excellent staff , quirky and different ! definitely return . pay twice the price for half the quality .",5.0
arrived to a very busy hotel - bar and restaurant were buzzing - we had arranged the festive afternoon tea - it did take a while to arrive we had finished our drinks before it got to us - selection of sandwiches were different and for me though they let down the experience - turkey one was ok but butternut and beetroot sandwich did not wow . best on the plates were the fresh scones - probably some of the best have ever had - sausages and bacon were a nice touch - and the and cheesecake also very nice - we ordered a extras toasty which was the best sandwich but you pay extra for it - lovely venue - comfortable and makes it a special occasion - service was very slow we asked over three times to pay - would eat here again - absolutely but not for the festive sandwiches,4.0
eating at since the first week they opend all those years ago ! all male waiters and proper spanish cooks is the key to the high volume of covers and service which has been ongoing with good plates of tastey dishes ! run restuarant with proffessional rare thing to find these choice of the know how to run a !,5.0

heard about the from a promotion . we had a cocktail in the ice bar wearing a cape and thick gloves . only criticism would be that they allow too many people in at the same time although did n't have to wait too long to be meal later in the restaurant was superb . great portions but of great quality . were professional although our waitress did struggle with some words . was quiet . of the tables were too close together . is one of the better restaurants in and recommend for an occasion .,4.0

"a table here for an evening meal after visiting the theater ( had been to the branch and expected good things . ) we arrived our table was not ready . problem , we could see that the table was being cleared and were sat down after a few minutes . , everything seemed to keep getting more disappointing throughout the evening . were asked for our drinks and were given ' water for the time being . waiter then asked if we wanted some appetizers so agreed , then minutes later the original waiter asked the same question , still without our ordered our food and the starters came out in no time which was great and tasted good too . ( still no drinks ) to ask different waiters for a spoon for the so another minutes of waiting for that and still no once we had finished our starters we again asked for our drinks and finally received them about minutes into our a bit of a wait for the mains but you could see they were understaffed , so luckily had our drinks to sip on and have a chat whilst waiting . table next to us had ordered after us yet their meals came before , although they were sent the mains came they were tasty so compliments to the chef , but again , waiting for these to be cleared up took forever and we just wanted to get the bill as there was n't any point staying for more drinks which we intended to do , as clearly they could n't cope . waiter then kept pushing my partner to look at the desserts which he had to say no to a few times and was quite irritating and began to look unprofessional . , another min wait for the card machine . bill had an extra % service charge which you would expect in , however in no way did we feel it deserved this . waiter input the full amount in the card reader with no option for my partner to decline the tip which was very regret our visit was not what we had expected from previous visits . 's really do make lovely food yet were let down by the incompetence of the staff . feel that as we were a younger couple , the whole time we were there we were treated as lesser valued customers and made to look , wish that my partner and went for the restaurant we visited previously at a well known branch that has better service and better value for money .",2.0
"waited for more than minutes for the main course ( after finishing the starters ) . pasta was just , one of the dishes was not cooked enough . and view at night is great , though . you have time to kill - take your chance .",2.0

"visited the pub many times on a night was looking forward to my dinner in the restaurant . we went through we were sat in a booth which was nice but they only had three menus and needed to print more off , this took an age . after asking to order our food more than once they took our food order . struggled to find much we wanted to eat on the menu ordered the seafood spaghetti in broth , so did my friend and the other two in the group ordered the rib eye steak . was barely edible , the prawns were still in their shell which meant you had to fish them out of the broth to peel and ended up not worth the bother . was tasteless and unappetizing , the steak sadly no better , tasted burnt and was tough . decided to skip pudding and went home for cheese on toast , leaving our wine unfinished .",2.0
"pub , good food , good atmosfere every weekend . love this place especially on and friday ( afterwork )",4.0
"understand that did not have a main meal but am really struggling to understand how this place has any low ratings . the staff were beyond friendly and helpful . afternoon tea was wonderful , even my husband enjoyed it and he really was n't looking forward to it as he likes a generous portion for his lunch ! 's on arrival were stunning and the free flowing champagne was definitely that free flowing . n't think managed to get to the bottom of my glass all afternoon before it was refilled . only get hours at your table and staff were genuinely surprised when we requested our bill after hours and insisted we had one more glass for road . definitely return and am booking it for my mum and dad as a gift we enjoyed it so much . return soon with friends .",5.0
serves food with a fast food concept . is done yourself at dedicated counters and made to order ( you can really customise it ) . tastes pretty good and definitely fresh . like the seating style where people can randomly join you if there is space on your table making it impersonal . recommend the deserts - they seem and taste mass would recommend for a good fairly economical meal ( basic ) meal .,4.0
in here by chance . simple small cafe offering a menu . was swift and polite . was fresh and tasted good . are great for central,4.0
"been here several times , great food and workers are great , new menu offers a lot more however portion sizes have become smaller - especially the muddy fries which originally could be shared amongst a few people , as well as this 've always had to wait half an hour for my food but guess the food is worth the wait !",5.0
cheap and cheerful - love it !,4.0
we got to the steakhouse we made a reservation for forty minutes from arrival as they were busy at that time when we went back they gave us a table at the lower level must say the service was poor too long a wait for our order to be taken when complained to the manager he said we did n't have a reservation originally then asked to be put on the top level they said there are no tables available however checked there were at least tables available let him know and he allowed us to have a table on the higher level there the service was very good and the food was exceptionally good,4.0

the fried or baked dumplings which we re delicious as usual ! then had a rice bowl fromm the menu . nervous as know like the noodle soups but fancied something a bit different . was n't disappointed ! chicken was really yummy and all the ingredients were crazy fresh and fragrant and there was so much flavour and it was n't at all dry like 'd feared . meal and would definitely go back just for that ! it 'll be on the menu for a while .,5.0
"of us ate at the last night and all enjoyed the food very much . is a small , simple and restaurant with a bar and some tables at the front , a little rather gloomy room with hangings on the wall at the back and ethnic music . certainly has a lot of competition in but think the food holds its own . had the compilation followed by some lamb , chicken and various sides and salads . particularly enjoyed the beetroot salad , cauliflower and dish of lentils and rice . were much amused by the description of how the chickens they serve are being bathed in tahini every day ! ? certainly tasted good . dessert had the which was like a less rich pannacotta flavoured with cardamom and covered in green herby stuff ( technical terms only ) . drank the cheapest red wine which tasted rough to start with but suited the robust flavours of the food very well . fantastic value for will return .",5.0

to try 's for dinner before going for a ordered mains : fish and chips plus a grilled with potatoes . fish and chips came overly fried and was a tad fishy . dish was nothing special either . paid pounds including tips for these mains . n't be back .,3.0
"on some of these reviews , went to this restaurant hoping to get some delicious fish and chips . waiting in line for almost an hour for a table was sure that this place must be great . the line got shorter there were groves of people popping up getting seated because they had reservations . probably should have gone next door to the 's takeaway restaurant instead of torturing myself watching people , waiting for their check , or their food . like there was not enough staff to get people 's checks ready or clear the tables . one point around it seem like all the waiters disappeared must have been on break or something . drinks were not refilled , no one checked to see if we needed anything , and we had to flag down any waiter that passed by the table . ordered cod fish and chips and it was horrible . was greasy and there was pool of oil on my plate . stomach got queasy after the second bite . chips look like bits and pieces of potatoes or crumbs . it was expensive for two cod fish and chips , one scampi meal and three drinks was almost pounds . forever to get the check and to pay .",2.0

here as wanted to stop to have something on the way to our hotel . restaurant itself was nice inside with a pleasant atmosphere and the waiter service was focaccia and starter game with melted garlic butter poured over it and it was over powering - hours later all we can taste is the garlic which is a even scraped mine off but still too portion sizes were generous and the food was ok. that basis would n't go again with so many options .,3.0
"came here with family and were seated in a most dismissive way . of the reasons for eating food is that it should not contain wheat as wheat was not originally grown in . to be told that only one of the stir fries and curries was gluten free came as a bit of a shock . suspect the meals are ( or at least ) and shipped in . sticky rice was beyond sticky and really just a lump of starch in a plastic bag , albeit hidden in a woven wicker basket . rice was not fragrant and the coconut rice lacked very nice , not going restaurant in the main body of the shopping mall is far superior and far less costly , although the surroundings are not as pleasant",2.0

restaurant con : went to for lunch today . for a small glass of wine . came but still seemed quite large and could only manage half of it . the bill came asked if it was a small glass and they said no it was large . said asked for a small glass the waiter angrily told me that would have to pay for a large glass since did n't send it back immediately . became very rude and suggested that had deliberately tried to pay for a small glass while drinking a large glass . the half full glass was standing on the table his argument was clearly rubbish and he was trying intimidation tactics . will not return .,1.0

"went on a late lunch - maybe and there was no queue , which was a nice surprise . little more than the price of a meal you can get something that 's infinitely tastier . downside is that it 's very tight - you might get bumped a bit if your back is to the aisle as mine was , and the service , as reported by others , is a little said , as a quick & fairly cheap lunch , 'd highly recommend .",4.0

"yourself to the smart , restaurant ( with prices to match ) , or just grab a table outside , as we did , with a takeaway . had haddock & chips , freshly cooked , and a tea . were generous , and the food . nice place to linger , but liked my meal so much that finished it in no time .",4.0
