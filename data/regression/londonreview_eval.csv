"for dinner with my boyfriend , really nice location inside the garden market , basically an open air restaurant . seat was heated but my boyfriend was cold the entire time ( other people just kept their coats on , not enough heating lamps around ) . bathroom is down a flight of steps outside the restaurant itself , a code is needed to access it ( provided by the waiter ) , 've seen cleaner ones for sure . the food , had the superfood salad with added chicken and loved it and the sticky toffee pudding as dessert ( to die for ) while my boyfriend had the roasted pork belly and it found the portion a bit meagre . he asked to change the beans with something else and while i understand that many restaurants wo n't even do that , the replacement consisted in a handful of salad which was n't equally filling ( maybe potatoes would have been better ) . had ice cream for dessert and was very pleased with it . also noticed the pizza ordered at other tables and they definitely looked like proper ones ( 'm italian , know what 'm talking about ) , cooked in a wood fired oven . friendly aussie waiter , considering that it 's , good value for money .",4.0
"was bought a three course meal here via groupon for my birthday and have to say was very disappointed with the whole evening . partner is so we thought it would take us back to our roots , firstly the waitress was very pleasant and we ordered our food without any fuss . starter was nice and although there was n't much of it you generally expect this from the first course . ordered chicken for my main and my partner had the spit roast of the day which was pork . it arrived was slightly shocked to see a whole baby chicken on my plate ! not even which is what chicken is ! and that was it ! veg , no potatoes nothing ! when asked where the rest was they said that this is all we get and if we want veg or potatoes etc we have to pay extra ! we were not told this at the time of ordering ! partner 's pork was two slices of pork belly with a baked bean sauce , defiantly and also nothing else ! . when it came to paying the bill they did n't take the total amount of the groupon voucher off which had already been paid by my brother as they said this includes groupon commission . ? could n't wait to get out of there as the whole experience was a waste of time . décor but absolutely nothing about it !",1.0
"floor contains a normal pub in this pretty setting . downstairs is a nice cosy restaurant and bar . enjoyed a delightful lunch with excellent ingredients , fresh and tasty . washed down with a lovely glass of . was excellent as was atmosphere . down side chairs are verrry low in relation to the table . found putting my plate on the extra stool provided the perfect height to eat from ! !",4.0
"night had , the phenomenal band , playing at . the place was humming , food and drink orders flying around the cheerful staff who were outperforming themselves with such a big crowd . was a warming dish on a cold night , but steaks were sizzling on the plate as much as the music was sizzling from the stage , which was framed by twinkling white lights and candles . atmosphere has to be experienced to be believed and the staff , who get to see live musicians nights a week ' - from time to time had to stop whirling about and just listen . are hoping that might become a tradition at , although the walls just might need to become elastic to accommodate everyone , of every age , who wants to listen to them in what is truly a very special place . is also worth noting that all the ticket money goes to the musicians - an unusual practice . , on many levels , thank you , !",5.0
sure where some of the other reviewers have been but my visits to 's at have always been a treat . had tea and a banana eclair . eclair was absolutely delicious . cheap but never been disappointed .,4.0
"here as part of a group of on a night , the restaurant was full but did n't feel like it - basically they do n't pack people in , so it retains a relaxed feel , as well as keeping the noise level down so you can still have a conversation with friends without shouting ! place is just very easy-going , great for a relaxed night out , but at the same time the staff were friendly and attentive . course , the food is the star here , it 's top quality . suspect they may have taken on board some of the criticism of portion size because we all certainly felt the starters and mains were sufficient not to have to worry about dessert . had a starter of squid with cauliflower and curry leaf - amazing - and shared a main course of braised ok cheek pie - similarly superb . noting the boys in our group also drank beer - although not listed on the menu , they do a very good locally produced and a wonderfully rich and velvety stout . in all a great night out , top quality food , with good friends in an informal surroundings - the only reason this does n't get was a mistake in the kitchen which meant our vegetable side dishes turned up a good minutes after the main course , a bit of a schoolboy error for any restaurant ! certainly wo n't stop me going again though . exactly cheap either , the bill came to approx per couple .",4.0
"now in my 'm verging into the realm of doing slightly more sophisticated things to enjoy the weekend rather than just raving . holiday evening met my boyfriend from work in and we headed via recommendation to for dinner . could be easily walked past if not aware of its existence but as soon as you walk through the doors and you 're struck with cosy atmosphere . we were walk-ins on a night we were able to sit straight at the bar . could have waited for a table but as it were just the two of us the bar suited us perfectly . it meant we could watch the bartenders concoct the cocktails in front of us . menu has something for everyone . , , and . 's best to treat it with a tapas approach to share as some dishes are larger than others . would recommend the and bruschetta . cocktails are small but packed with alcohol . 's rather expensive as expected from but as a treat it was totally worth it ( at least hope he thinks so as he paid ! )",4.0
"a gig at the and this restaurant was near the . did choose it after reading reviews on . friendly and restaurant basic but appeared to be relatively clean but décor a bit shabby . ordered soup , and , plain boiled rice , mackerel sushi and rolls . was absolutely delicious and so fresh . priced for the amount we ate . definitely return when again in the area . rated this restaurant as very good as we could not fault the food we had but would suggest the restaurant has a spruce up soon .",4.0
"good value for money in an overpriced city , healthy options are available as well as sweet treats . there are branches all over london",4.0
"with family after watching a show . was excellent quality but the staff were ' in a chic kind of way , no smiles , no banter and no variations from menu the beer they do n't serve a full pint unless you ask for a top up , the first pint they tried to give me was almost a third frome because the barrel was running out , a request to top up proved the barrel was empty",4.0
"parents and had dinner here and we are all very happy with our food , and the service . and custard ice cream was particularly good and we ended up getting a second scoop . , an good meal .",4.0
"is a very pretty little restaurant , a little off the beaten track but still conveniently located . really liked the ambience - nice & relaxed ( apart from our group of excitable ladies , having a big catch-up ! ) all ordered & tasted lots of different dishes , which were all delicious - the chicken nearly blew our heads off though , super fiery ! good selection of wine and service from the staff reinforced our positive impression of this lace . return to this cosy location on a night ' in the near future !",4.0
"is really a great place to get a taste of food in . nicely in the heart of the portobello road , the place is very cozy and has its own unique charm being situated under the tube rail track . 's a family run restaurant which serve various food , including campur which is reasonably priced . they have tarik , nothing beats a hot tarik on a chilly day in . owners are really friendly and accommodating , really enjoyed the service . any first time traveller to looking for food , 'll definitely would recommend you to visit . , portobello market should be one the places to visit while in , so why not drop by while you 're there .",5.0
"wanted an early afternoon tea with flowing champagne ' and the and in the provided exactly what we were looking for . vintage champagne did not stop flowing during the hours we were dining . food was fairly typical for afternoon tea , with neat little sandwiches , scones with jam and cream and a number of fancy . initially wondering whether there may be delays between champagne refills , we were pleasantly surprised to receive ups ' more frequently than anticipated . all we may of received or glasses each . are a number of agents offering special rates for this venue - including and . restaurant is comfortable and nicely decorated but does not have views . staff are very friendly and attentive . value for money ! !",4.0
"love my pizza and love their pizza . the and the dough could well have been made by the hand of . better than certain other pizza places and well worth a visit , or take away .",5.0
"the scotch eggs at this place are magnificent . here with some colleagues from ( these chaps know a good beer when the taste one ) . selection of well kept real ales on offer everything from their own , very good , to a delicious sweet , think . in all if you fancy a proper pint you wo n't find a better spot .",4.0
"is a nice pub to leave close to . 's a little bourgeoisie and tends to fill up with suits , but has some decent beer and is definitely a lovely place to spend a few hours .",3.0
"staff were very nice but the whole experience was not , out of our tea pots were chipped or had dirty cracks and the sandwiches and cakes were stale as if they had been made hours ago and left . atmosphere was more like an cafe which is n't awful but this was a treat for me and my friends which we had high expectations for as we have done the same thing in other places and if we did n't want that . do n't recommend them especially for the price when you can get a lot better for less . hotels should try and reflect the standards they portray .",2.0
"stuffy hotel restaurant , high priced , not worth the money . went there as a family given it 's great reviews , while the food was good , the service was good , the atmosphere was like a . worth the money .",3.0

'll certainly be dining again there !",5.0
"been here a few times before over the years , as live in the area , but never for dinner . must say that was delighted by my experience . crab cakes had were fantastic , on par with that of an upscale restaurant and in turn excellent value for money . decor and atmosphere inside was equally as splendid , maintaining a casual yet sophisticated air about the place fit for a romantic evening , a quiet drink with friends or a celebratory meal . staff 's enthusiasm and attention to detail is also second to none , and emmeline 's help during our meal was much appreciated in enhancing the experience , making sure all of our culinary needs were met . young man behind the bar , , was also a pleasure to have serving us , and his extensive knowledge of beer coupled with his laid-back but humorous attitude left my husband particularly impressed , as he considers himself quite the craft beer connoisseur . , ca n't wait to return for the plough for another momentous and memorable evening , and am already planning to recommend it as the venue for our staff party . up the impeccable work !",5.0
"have used this restaurant for nearly ten years and always enjoyed my visits there . has the flexibility of tapas main meals such as paella complemented by are some seats outside , some inside at ground floor level in the bar area and many more downstairs . preference is the bar area as downstairs does n't have the same is one of the few places know which serve good food most of the day and even until late at night . is a ten minute walk away so the is very convenient before getting the coach home .",5.0
"went here while staying at the and decided to go to 's grill after staying at one of his wonderful hotels near bath and having a wonderful meal there . were not disappointed ! staff were friendly , helpful and were attentive without pestering you . was a lovely relaxed evening , with the best steak have had in ages . was cooked perfectly and simply melted in the mouth . was a pretty good wine list , which covers most budgets as in all , well priced , fantastic steak , in a relaxed atmosphere . go back .",5.0
weekend with the students away . seemed disinterested . real ale for the second consecutive visit .,2.0
live locally and have n't been here for over years . thought would pop in on a sunny weekend . service was slow and it took quite a while for our order to be taken . only ordered a main course each . was awful pasta and the meatballs were really poor . was not high quality meat . whole experience was below average . are so many other places on the to try and so to have repeat customers you really have to improve your offering . looks so lovely from the outside so it was a shame to have such a poor experience .,2.0
though the menu is reduced in the number of dishes the ramen in was very good . service was extra fast .,4.0
we went to for a family lunch and were n't disappointed food at very reasonable cost . certainly would go again type food but something for everyone,4.0
"visited in after searching the internets for somewhere new ( and more importantly vegan ) to eat in . girlfriend and had mixed opinions at the end of our late night meal . 'm not a massive fan of food normally , but actually really enjoyed the dishes - had a variety of starters and tried the for my main ; a rice based vegetable dish with miso soup and marinated peanuts which was very nice and filling . other half felt the food was slightly overpriced , and commented on the small portions . both thought the service was very good and the staff were very friendly and welcoming - especially as we were the last to leave ! a visit for something different in the center of .",4.0
"visited with my husband on for a casual dinner . food was standard fare , well flavoured and cooked , with plentiful portions . had a mixed mezze , mixed grill nd baklava to share and it was all pretty good . atmosphere was very relaxed and the service extremely friendly and attentive . had courses and a pretty nice bottle of wine for including the tip , great value for money !",5.0
"pasta , very good choice of wine , and friendly service . becoming a local favourite . generous portions that would satisfy the largest appetite .",5.0
"had an excellent dinner at another we decided to try this for a light lunch . enjoyed a very pleasant vegetarian risotto - and when we pointed out that one of the ingredients was missing , we were rapidly brought the missing item . it should not have been missing , we were still very happy with our meal and a drinkable glass off rose . the thing for a lunch in central .",4.0
"prior to theatre so we were in hurry but had about an hour the food is terribly cooked and presented - had burger with chips all of it awful , burger was lumpy in places very dry and bland , old dry salad green bits on top with thick piece of bland tomato , the bun was just so dry it fell apart - 's that i knew when i was a younger when it was considered proper diner - too many kids running the show , need to pay for some proper chefs that know what they are doing - but it 's in a good location and was packed out so 's probably could n't care less about this review thought to post it ! ! ! .",1.0
"a very busy time of the day ( before an athletics meet at the ) we were seated , ordered and served very quickly , the food was lovely , not sure about sharing a table though !",4.0
"went on voucher - maybe that was the problem . you drive you cant park anywhere near the place , unless you use their expensive valet me minutes to find a parking space and walk back to the restaurant . - posh nosh we thought , must be worth it ? steak had was so chewy it was beyond belief . know when your chewing on a piece of meat , and after a while it dawns on you that your jaw is aching and that you feel like you will choke if you swallow what 's in your mouth ? every mouthful was like that . had to go to washroom to expel as i simply could n't handle chewing for another minutes . love my steak , eat all over the city . was appalling , esp for a place that is so pleased with itself its in danger of going blind . 've only been once - so accept it might have just been bad luck . 'm not wealthy enough to risk it again though . service was , but again like many ( but not all ) places in , you felt like a prol in a palace of the mighty .",2.0
"absolutely enjoyed breakfast there . recommend the eggs royale , pancakes and french toast . is good as well",4.0
"lived in the area for months and walking past the most days , we finally went in for dinner a couple of months ago . , wish we 'd done it far sooner ! the owner is the making of this place he 's absolutely full of beans and the craic is brilliant . food is homely , absolutely tremendous value and really well made . 've been back many times since with friends and we always have a great night . 's wine too . you 're in the area make sure you book in and give this place a go whilst it may not look like much from the outside you 're guaranteed a great night once inside",5.0
"here for lunch and had steak and salad for plus tomato juice , sparkling water and a couple of coffees . was pricey particularly as the steak was under cooked and had to be sent back said the staff were very friendly , helpful and did offer a completely new steak - hate throwing food away so was more than happy to have the existing one cooked more",3.0
"a very crowded street , you might be forgiven for just picking a restaurant by the external cosmetic appearance - but do n't be fooled , the quality of the food can be different . is n't the most ostentatious or street front , and the decor inside is standard stuff . the food is excellent : tasty , decent portions , and great value for money . staff are efficient without being overbearing , and the prices ca n't be n't be afraid to negotiate with the door host , they will generally match other offers . !",4.0
"went on for a late lunch after being told it was a good place to eat . 's name on the door thought a treat was in store was very had the woodman pizza and it was just about edible and probably because was very hungry at pm . was on the menu as containing , wild mushrooms , red onion , cheese and and tarragon . and it was called a when it arrived it had a mushy mushroom paste across the thin crispy base , and on top were half a dozen poorly looking mushrooms , a few tiny bits of red onion , and melted patches of cheese . topped with a scattering of herbs . do a better one for and this cost just on . know its covent garden , know its oliver but for goodness sake it was appalling . the tables were very close together , the place itself needs a real cleaning and the staff too leave a lot to be desired both in their personal cleanliness and manners . have to say the place was very busy , including a queue but can honestly say would never return and feel sure a lot of customers would feel the same . we took some friends for lunch expecting them to be well fed on food and they too were very disappointed . have to say in all aspects !",2.0
"wow and wow again , firstly the views , well lit up at night , is the most beautiful city in the world , and the views looking out from this gorgeous restaurant high up in the sky were more than spectacular . food was absolutely first class and my starter of fruits of the sea linguine was one of the most amazing dishes have ever eaten . my short rib main was not only melt in the mouth divine , but also beautifully presented . apricot parfait dessert with peaches , almond granola , and toasted almond ice cream was just an explosion of deliciousness . washed down with not one but two cocktails , probably one of the best cocktails 've ever had . ca n't say what everyone else had in our part of four , or will give away the whole menu ! ! ! will say that the portions were not massive , however did not go home hungry . was also excellent . it was a belated birthday treat for of us , they sent us home with cakes , which was such a nice was very expensive ( in fact eye watering expensive ) , but the food , the decor , the service , and the spectacular views made it an experience would definitely want to repeat . it .",5.0
"shocking experience told an hour wait as very busy did n't mind that . sat waiting for over an hour for a table . of empty tables all around . mins when asked if we could have one of the empty tables told we do n't have the waitresses to cover all the tables , pretty poor planning for a large restaurant group weekend before ! ! ! been told we have run out of all draft drinks as `` the manger has n't put the order in '' been called to table & the buzzer girl from reception desk pretty much threw the menus on the table & walked off . came for the kids never again , can think of many alternatives that would be only too please to welcome , look after & take my money with a smile .",1.0
"go here fairly frequently . like that it 's spacious so you have a good chance of getting a seat at most times , and the décor is good and the drinks are . find what lets it down is ( much worse than other weatherspoons ) once we saw a neighbouring table send their roast back to the kitchen because the gravy was frozen ! ! 've had to send food back in the past before as well which we 've never had to do anywhere else , or they forget to put something on the plate which is mentioned as coming with the meal on the can also be a bit on the rude side too sometimes eg despite seeing lots of customers waiting there will be one or people behind the bar talking to each other or cleaning whilst one of their colleagues tries to deal with all the people waiting .",3.0
"'s difficult to criticise for anything other than to say that think it is a little went on a lunchtime and as soon as you walk in it has a great buzz about it , great atmosphere and very welcoming . had a sushi dish to start , a in tempura batter , prawns , pork skewers , on the bone halibut and a couple of desserts . had non-alcoholic drinks , a bottle of water , half a carafe of wine ( ) and a coffee each . bill came to just over including the tip . we ordered alcoholic and a reasonably priced bottle of wine , the bill would imagine been the wrong side of . am sure a lot of people reading this will say what do you expect from a restaurant in central , but whilst the food was very nice , did think it was a little steep for what we said , the service is just right ( not too attentive but always someone there when you need them ) , the atmosphere is really lively , the decor is impressive and it 's difficult not to enjoy yourself . 've given it a very good rating because despite my view on the price , did have a really good afternoon and would go back again .",4.0
"'ve been to a fair few ! is always this was our time , and this evening my husband sampled the cured meat starter ( big enough to be a main ) and a pizza , while had the delicious crab ravioli starter and an order of mussels with plenty of warm bread . portions are generous , the staff and the food so good that we felt like falling asleep at the table . n't recommend this restaurant enough .",5.0
"the service here very patronising - not sure if it was because we were ladies alone or because of the traditional style service . people may like the flamboyant style but not me , ok and good value but wine and antipasto platter very expensive . came with decent amount of hams ( although not enough prosciutto , or and too much salami / mortadella style for my preference ) but only hard ( and similar ) cheeses . because the platter cost and we had to order separate bread at - all the additional % service charge of course ! n't be returning sorry .",3.0
"in as was staying in a hotel nearby . off chance visit . n't disappointed . , noisey , fun and anonymous . chicken salad was very good , fabulous service , and reasonably priced . definitely return and would encourage others to call in .",4.0
"there arrived at on a without booking as we expected it to be quiet ( unlike a weekend lunchtime as the unfortunate last reviewer on ; is hyper busy at weekends , trip advisor and locals would mean a packed house ) . seated quirky restaurant had a mix of furnishings , shop dining table and chairs for six at the rear . by the front door for people waiting . four others were in the place when we arrived and two happily the praises of this establishment ! the lamb shank is well worth it , only by ordering in advance as can not predict numbers . it was quiet tom personally sat with us and briefed us in what was available and the extras ! great detail the pies were described , all sounded great so had the beef , and horseradish . eggs and chunky crispy chips were ordered by my friend , beef steak and mushroom by my other friend . vegetables ( cabbage , carrots and offered the real mashed potato and lasagne , all tempting !

"recently visited following a recommendation and was n't disappointed . venue , has the feel of private members bar . service , nice and spacious , very well put together drinks and they know what they 're talking about ! will be back soon to sample the cabaret that hear is on offer some nights .",5.0
"was looking fro a good place to have lunch in and boy did find place : the ! ambiance is light , floor to ceiling glass walls with view on trees of the . staff were very friendly , was alone and they gave me a fine table . ordered sea bass and a glass of champagne . fish was super fresh and excellently prepared . champagne was from the finest ! pancakes à la française were prepared with a fine strawberry sauce . place is classy , all about no stress , a super place for afternoon tea . the price was good value fro the money . recommend this to everyone who likes quite well organized high quality dining for an exceptional price .",5.0
"long history of the oldest in shows in the elegance of the , the excellent dishes and the well trained and attentive staff . started as an oyster so started with oysters , and they were as good as the , the main dish was roast beef , shared with my , and it had the excellent budding and other side dishes , it was very good but it was served sliced and off the bone and had expected the traditional roast used to get in a wife loved her grilled salmon , and the beautiful decor and ambiance made it a very nice evening .",4.0
"were genuinely impressed with this restaurant , a real authentic feel and our and year old daughters were very impressed , not easily done ! of us had , had and had the , our year old did n't actually eat anything but that 's not unusual . were very pleasant , décor is basic , hence the authentic feel . food arrived very promptly and we ordered an extra plain noodle dish for our youngest . total although we mostly drank tap water . value and friendly , makes a lovely change to chain restaurants !",4.0
"close to this branch in , and wanted a simple meal early evening on a night . thought `` its just a pizza place '' it will do for a quick meal . looked clean and bright and on entry we were greeted by a most pleasant server who obviously know his job . marks to him . a very acceptable bottle of wine , a pizza and a pasta , followed by desserts and coffee . really good meal in a pleasant environment served by friendly staff . a discount on the meal for showing a map . just a pizza place , how wrong can you be .",5.0
"sister had the and had pizza . both were pretty dire ! the parmigiana cheese ! the sauce was just tomato paste no basil mushy aubergine barely discernible , no flavour , greasy and burnt onto the dish in the micro wave . horrid , pizza was flabby and tasteless ; we complained , to be told that the parmigiana was in a tomato sauce ! well if that is the case they have some thing to learn here about how to make a tomato sauce , and the comment about the pizza was that it was supposed to be like that ( ! ) we were offer % our bill ( to ahow how we honour you ) ( offer quickly with drawn when asked if it was on top of the % discount coupon given to us at the door ) had two luke warm coffees as compensation . cap it all the waiter did not bring my change had to find him and ask for it and then waiters argued about whose fault that gain a horrible experience",1.0
food and not expensive for london . staff was very . restaurant is suitable for children .,4.0
"can not stress enough how much hate this restaurant . of all the service is the worst have experienced in a long time , not because they were rude , but the waiter was just plain inept . he took ages to take our order , then he brought the drinks minutes afterwards ( and only half of them ) , he was very inattentive about everything and just did everything badly - was awful , like he was doing us a favour by being there . the prices are just ridiculous . charge pounds for rolls that are mostly rice and a bit of vegetables , most of the food is just really bland and boring ( and am not saying this because it 's vegan , have been to other vegan places that are good ) can get better quality vegetable rolls in any sushi restaurant and it 's dramatically cheaper . paid pounds for four people with a taste card discount and felt so top it all off they do n't take . do n't mind if a place does n't take if it 's really cheap , but if am going to be paying these stupid prices at least expected that do yourself a favour and avoid this place at all costs . , never go here unless you just want to promote bland food and bad service at high costs .",1.0
"ran our party at the on a very busy night and had a fantastic time . venue looked great , was so easy for everyone to get to and what a view ! ! staff were fantastic , very helpful when needed but not at all food was very well received , especially by those with large appetites ! ! portions were huge ! ! great party venue highly recommended .",5.0
"cooking in a quiet street in central . is a lunchtime favourite during the workweek because you can always get a table , the meals are made fresh to order and the staff are so friendly . will make you feel welcomed each time and will even know your favourite dish . worth a visit if you ’ re near or in the area .",4.0
"booked lunch for people , and several days later , we 're all still talking ( and spreading the word ) about what a fabulous time we had ! food was excellent - by far , the best restaurant food have had ! rhubarb and its dressing that was served with the scallop and tiger prawn starter was so delicious , and this is from someone who has always said that they do n't like rhubarb ! very much to the chefs , and and to and for making sure we had a meal and experience to remember .",5.0
have visited a few times and each time is like returning to gastronomic paradise . certainly has what is probably the best breakfast in without the noise and large crowds found in . staff are all brilliant and they serve up amazing freshly squeezed and blended juices along with wonderful coffee to go with the lovely mains and pastries ! definitely recommend visiting on or for the best brunch of your life . would suggest calling ahead to reserve a table if your party consist of more than people .,5.0
", great location and fresh ingredients . to choose from and plenty of variety between wraps so it 's hard to get bored of coming here !",5.0
"were drawn to this restaurant as we have travelled around and a lot of the food has influences . ordered a chicken and my husband had a lamb dish , pilau rice an aubergine side dish which was supposed to be with chillies , garlic cumin , ginger and fresh coriander , it was probably the dish have ever eaten . was okay bit too much fennel in for me and my husband lamb dish was passable . had a naan and a with one bottle of house wine . cost us which thought was quite expensive but they add a service charge , what for am not sure and if it had been down to me they would not have got anything . service was flat , no smiles and other people had complimentary drinks at the end of their meal . wont be back and will return to where the food , cost and service are infinitely better in my opinion !",3.0
"ambience and service at 's was very good on our most recent visit . arrived quickly and top ups were always timely and made without having to request them . members of staff were knowledgeable of the though included a seemingly unnecessary delay before being seated while some keyboard tapping went off at the maitre 'd desk ; having to fiddle with the seal on the miniature tabasco bottle that came with the oysters ( please this , 've bought it regardless of whether choose to use it ) ; and some kind of under sweetened apple tart that was advised on the menu as being tarte tatin . tatin is a thing , not something needing reinvention . experience still good though and 'll be back for more .",4.0
stayed in the hotel and paid pound per person per day for the breakfast buffet . variety of food is okay do not agree to pay extra pound to get an omelet with not that extra . breakfast timing should extend to am especially in summer because the day is too long,3.0
"of us went to eat there on new year 's eve because it was close to our , the food was alright for the price we paid but we waited for ages and the service was absolutely hopeless : not enough personnel ( only for the whole restaurant ) and our server had no idea of what he was doing , we got served after a group of people that arrived min after us , we asked for a starter that came min after our main courses and a glass of wine that actually never came even though we told the guy several times we were getting pretty angry and he was just wondering around back and forth behind the bar and empty handed ( the drinks were sitting on that bar all that time ) . bad experience",2.0

great place : great music and great vibes . would suggest you get the house punch as it 's fruity and alcoholic . would n't suggest you get any other cocktails as they 're quite pricey and quite weak . food ! - rude boy fries are definitely my fave lots of herby flakes on top ! downer is you do have to pay for your condiments . can get quite busy so book a table . would recommend . had a really nice time there with my pals ! will be going back for more punches and rude boy fries !,4.0
"place has a good vibe , nice decor and a simple was walking in the door , the waitress in quite literally barged into me despite me being halfway through the door and did n't even acknowledge me , let alone say sorry - great start ! all ordered meatballs , they came in good time . two friends meatballs were cooked very well , but mine was raw in the middle . they use pork in their meatballs and the meat in the middle was cold , tried to get the attention of members of staff . the one ( the girl from the front door ) finally paid attention to me , she put her up at me to tell me to wait as she wondered towards the kitchen are you serious ? ! , she did n't come back and had to grab one of the guys walking past . told him my meatball was raw inside and he looked at me puzzled . asked him if it was supposed to be like that and he said think so ' . that is the case , my friends meatballs are overcooked took the plate away without apologising and minutes later after my friends had finished , the snotty waitress delivered my meatballs - by deliver mean she hurled them from a distance and they down in front of me . did n't say a single word , before or after the meatball meatballs were finally cooked and the food was nice considering the price is very reasonable . would gladly eat here again if it was n't for the other shortcomings . this , not a single soul asked me or my friends how our food was during the entirety of the asked for the bill , which was delivered by the manager . guessed it , she never asked once how our food was - she did n't even know had been served raw meat . only did it come with my raw meatballs on , but there was a % service charge on there ! can only assume the owners of this place have never been here , unless they are actively trying to get themselves on 's .",1.0

pubs near main line station termini are a bit rough and ready so was n't expecting much from this place right outside but it 's not bad . beer is very good and the staff polite if not the most efficient and it 's a comfortable place to have a drink waiting for a train but you 've got to love sports on the big screens which are everywhere,3.0

"a fairly prolific diner , was most intrigued upon hearing of this new eatery . had heard from friends of mine had been more than enough to stir up my the minimalist aesthetic , the long waiting times , and of course the ( who would have thought it ) food arranged our booking via e-mail ( the process being initiated weeks prior to the date ) , was more than apprehensive upon no more than a handful of tables within the premises ( being , pretty much , a rather bland but clean garden setting ) greeted by name went some way to reassure my nerves , as we were shown out table by the . complementary table water sated our first as we browsed the small yet satisfying wine we were pushed for time , we only settled for starter and main . starter of peas with creme fraiche and pancetta with french toast was both appetite and the perfect entree , wife 's baked aubergine with feta and mint was equally delicious . not the most ambitious of dishes , they were faultless in their presentation and my main opted for the steak a classic so often that was quite anxious upon its arrival . was elated to find it was the locally sourced mustard serving as a perfect complement to a rather brave dish for an establishment of this size . wife 's cuttlefish bolognaise was initial disappointment ( though do n't know what we had in mind ) gave way to a rewarding , slightly mystifying meal . was hugely enjoyable , as food should be , and quite unlike anything we 've had a real discovery which made for excellent conversation ! setting was certainly am not personally one who enjoys eating outside . , the cleanliness of the environment put me at ease somewhat . would suggest some low-level ambient music for the sake of the atmosphere , but all in all can find it hard t fault this new venture . had a pleasant time that we will no doubt reminisce over for many months to come .",5.0

'' 'll talk about the service first because it 's crucial that have it mentioned . staff members are friendly , very sociable and they actually just sit down with you whenever you 're getting your order done or if you 've made a complaint , which 'll get to . gives high marks for the service they provide . for surrounding , it 's very cosy . definitely do have this hipster vibe going down , including the casual music playing in the background . a great feel for this restaurant . we 'll get to the meat of the review ( puns not intended ) , which is the steak and the side dishes . 've ordered my flat iron steak to be with a complimentary house salad , as recommended , with a side of dripping chips and peppercorn sauce . to this , was given a complimentary mug of butter flavoured popcorn , which took pleasure into nibbling . 've ordered a bottle of lager which went down well with the steak . n't remember the name , sadly ; moment my dish arrived , it was time to dig in ! ! first impression of the steak was very important . it disappoint ? ! ! was sheer beauty with its smokey , flavour . was colder than had anticipated , like room temperature , but knew the risk of ordering steaks that are not fully cooked by request and ca n't hold it against them . was indeed well seasoned with a sprinkle of sea salt on top . a cheap cut steak used as the main gimmick for the restaurant , perfectly executed ! the side dishes , the moment took my first crunch into a my god ! flavour and the was to die for ! enjoyed every second of it ! to dip with the peppercorn sauce , which may add is perfect to go with your steak indeed ! with the house salad , it was your basic , lamb 's lettuce leaves where your mustard dressing is included . indeed , actually enjoyed my salad with my steak . , felt a serious sandy `` '' from my salad . thought to myself , `` ai n't normal '' . moment finished my meal , spoke to the waiter about the salad texture in my salad . said it could be salt , though salt should n't be hard to chew into at all . this comes back into the service ratings , the waiter came back to my table , stand on the stool opposite me and told me that 'm getting % discount , which is absolutely mega ! ! 's not everyday go to a restaurant and get a discount high for a foreign object in my meal . felt that it was too much . 'd probably expect a % or a % if they would discount me but % is too could n't really pass up how great the service truly is . that out of the way , ordered dessert , which is the with vanilla syrup and hot chocolate sauce . the moment got my sundae , tucked into it . delightful ! one of the best sundaes 've had with salted caramel that tastes so rich , sweet and salty with a soft and creamy ice cream . syrup is potent on its own , but adds a great addition to the sundae , the same goes with the chocolate , except it is more that being said , is a delicious steakhouse restaurant on the cheap ! gimmick with the cheapest cut of meat that 's made into something that tastes of heaven . executed lads ! 'll have to try out the or take on the sirloin one day . will tell . : ; restaurant , great food , top notch customer service . % recommended with a seal of approval !",5.0
"went here for an early dinner on evening and even at the ground floor was full . basement is a bit dark but at least there were some seats ! chairs and stools are really quite uncomfortable which is a problem as the food is so good you want to stay all evening . had some of the starters which were really delicious , followed by the piadina meatball smash ( fantastic ! ) and the whole mozzarella with broad beans , nearly as lovely . finished off with great espresso and amaretto . food was brilliant , the waiters very nice and helpful even though the place was really busy , and apart from the the ambience is great . seemed quite expensive but it is right in the middle of and as the food was so good ca n't moan about the price .

partner and go to try tapas almost once a week ! found this place through the taste card directory of restaurants . we first went there we thought the place was not great but when the food arrived we were blown away ! food is absolutely amazing with the pig cheeks and the bake being our all time favourite . tapas are a bit pricy but it is excellent value if you have the taste card . staff is very nice and the venue is probably the only thing that needs some improvement . in all would definitely recommend this place - one of the tastiest tapas food in - and there are n't many !,4.0

"friends invited us out to lunch at the of . 'm generally of the opinion that lunch is one of the few meals that 's better cooked at home than in a pub or restaurant , but some recent experiences are starting to challenge that perception . first was a very agreeable lunch at the in . second was the of , was out first visit to the pub , which is easy enough to find - a hop , skip and a jump from or stations and plenty of metered parking on the streets outside . parking is free on a and we had no trouble finding a space . pub has both a lounge and a dining room but there 's no doubt that it 's geared up for food . 's a dearth of nice seating for sitting and just lolling about enjoying a pint , and with the exception of the stools at the bar , all the seats are at dining tables . matter - we were here for the said , the venue has three real ales on tap , an admirable selection of craft beers , and a nice wine list . sampled all three ales - the wife was driving - and they were very well kept and rather agreeable building was clearly built as a pub and the sign above the door would indicate it was previously a of . they have done that terribly trendy thing of painting all the ( no doubt lovely ) wooden surfaces grey , which appreciate is fashionable but does seem somewhat sterile to ate in the dining room , which is upstairs via a helical staircase . food itself is excellent - a full range of sauces to accompany each type of meat are available , which on their `` three roasts roast '' ( a slice each of beef and lamb , and a chicken leg ) made for an interesting combination . thoroughly enjoyed the meal , and the staff were our meal and desserts , which were also superb , our waiter did ask us to vacate our table in the next quarter of an hour , but made it clear we were welcome to stay there if we were going to have more drinks , which we 'd have been happy to do but did n't have per person on lunch , before drinks and gratuity , is a bit steep , and we certainly could n't do it every week . for a treat the quality and are superb , so 'd say that it 's excellent summary : food spot on , drinks spot on , staff spot on , restaurant a bit sterile . could have given this place a out of five , would have .

"will not go back to this pub ever again ! booked a table for six in the old dairy for a roast lunch and a catch up with some friends . calling the pub earlier that morning , it was confirmed that a particular football would be played , which is the reason we decided to spend our afternoon at the old dairy as opposed to the many other gastro pubs in the area . were pleased to see that the pub had in fact advertised on their daily menu that the match would be shown . an average and overpriced roast dinner , we went to the bar section where we asked the bar man to put on the match . were answered with a blunt ' . said it said that it stated on their printed menu that it would be shown , to which he responded arrogantly it is n't ' . asked him to check this , at which pointed he stormed off shaking his head . he returned having seen the menu which it clearly stated they were showing the match , a lame excuse was given and still the match would not be shown . informed him that we had based out expensive lunch and afternoon around this pub based on their false advertisement and had even phoned to double check this earlier in the day . offered what felt like feigned and insincere apology . then went across the road to the ' pub where the staff without hesitation put on the match and greeted us warmly and sincerely . will not be going to the over-rated old dairy ever again .",1.0

"a great night at the theatre my partner and called in here because had a craving for pasta . asked to sit outside and were told that after it is not allowed , although it was only did n't argue . ordered food , ordered an oven baked pasta dish which should have been a mix of crispy pancetta chicken cheese and pasta . the meals arrived was told not to touch the metal dish as it will be piping hot , took a mouthful and the food was stone cold , then picked up the piping hot dish and it too was cold . asked the waiter to get another one , he was very apologetic and took it away returned with some free bread . minutes later my partner had finished eating and my oven baked dish returned . second offering from the kitchen was warmer they had clearly shoved some extra bits in and put it back in the oven . pancetta looked like raw chicken it was so not crispy , the two tiny pieces of chicken managed to hunt out through the vast amount of undercooked chewy was underwhelmed and so annoyed asked the waiter to take t away and he asked me if would like to speak to the manager said did , eventually she came to the table explained that the food was not great that my partner ate alone ten was served my meal and that it was n't really acceptable . did not at all apologise but said she would take it off the bill . asked for the bill and when it arrived she had given us a % discount which did n't even equate to half of the cost of the disgusting dish . called the waiter and he rectified and we left . am sure this is not the standard expected at bella and will not return to the restaurant , we were not the only table complaining of cold food either !",1.0

time here lovely old theatre turned into a . and place in queue taken without saying so when finally served was served by a stroppy barmaid with a nose ring that asked me to show the beer wanted when jokingly asking if it was her first day she snapped `` no !

"give some background to this review , am a huge fan of , have all of his books , follow his shows ( except the ones on the sink estates ) and in fact have cooked hundreds of his recipes over the years ( successfully might add ) and 'm a big supporter of the way he tries to educate us to be brave and experiment with food . the way cook and wo n't ( normally ) hear a bad word said about the guy ! now that is . were in to see a show and wandered around and planned to eat before heading to the and had a place in mind that we had been to before . on seeing the menu on the wall of this restaurant with 's name emblazoned on the menu we went in absolutely positive we were in safe hands . restaurant looks trendy , the staff were friendly , polite and there were lots of them , despite only a small handful of customers . 's not like me to venture into any restaurant without checking first , and our experience here reminds me why . was a very cold night and it looked inviting with wall heaters and plenty ( almost all ) tables free . could possibly go wrong ? the starters available did not inspire us to choose any ( disappointed straight away ) so we went straight for mains , we had not noticed the lack of appealing starters before we headed into the restaurant and were seated ready to order . we both ordered mains of pizza described as `` pulled slow roasted pork , apple sauce and with pork crackling '' . sounded different . what arrived was virtually tasteless . small amount of pork that was there tasted nice but the rest of the pizza was bland beyond belief . was also covered with a huge amount of water cress . very trendy but there is only so much watercress a pizza can take ! would have added flavour as well as colour . cress added only colour and attempted to cover the fact that there was little topping underneath . have added pics and do n't be fooled into thinking there is a good amount of pork on the pizza , what you can see is mainly crackling . ordering the pizza we looked for a nice dessert to order after the main but the choice was awful . ' roll , blueberry tart , black forest gateaux or cheese and biscuits or ice cream . get that they are trying to rejuvenate the food from the seventies but the very few choices left me uninspired . publicity wrongly states their pizzas are `` universally loved ! '' beg to differ . also states they aim to take us on a `` journey of discovery through and reintroduce us to familiar flavours '' are so many fabulous innovative dishes available today it seems odd and just wrong on every level to want to bring back something that went out of favour because better choices came along ? makes me shudder to think the tourists coming here will leave thinking this is what our top chefs are capable of . was a cold evening , there were heated seats and overhead heaters but we were still chilly sitting there so the thought of a cold dessert ? we left without dessert and went instead to a nice coffee bar near the theatre and had a fabulous dessert . can not understand how this wonderful chef can allow this food to be cooked in his name . he got too big and too famous to have time to care ? sincerely hope not but the evidence is that despite bad reviews on here he is not listening . is not the only bad review on here , had read the reviews on here before walking in we would have gone elsewhere . is important what paying customers think . accepting they are subjective , turning a blind eye regardless is a mistake . is a fabulous location and yes it 's probably mainly tourists who are the target market but please let them leave with a great impression of food and not underwhelmed as we were . some of the fabulous recipes from his books would be more impressive there 's no shortage of inspirational recipes available . work well and taste delicious , sadly ca n't say the same about the food on offer here . have to speak as find and am sad to say your venture is a huge let down .",2.0

"visit to , the last one was months ago , the menu has changed quite a bit and so has the wine menu , items we had all been looking forward to no longer there which was a real shame but change is what keeps things fresh so have to accept and wine were as always fantastic and could not be faulted at all , what was a shame is the front of house has gone down hill , no real smiles or warm friendly ness anymore , we were early so having a drink at the bar and mentioned to one of the team walking past that we had a table booked and wanted to just say we are here , promptly she pointed to the gathering of ladies around a desk to enter the restaurant and told us to go over there and tell them we bothered her as she was busy we could tell as she went and joined the ladies at the said desk and had a conversation about well i can only assume the weather because i still had to go over and say we had were a few other moments with coat collection etc which all just spoilt the service you expect in a place like the restaurant though could not fault the service it was excellent as always .",3.0

"thought of a 's breakfast ( or 's anything , for that matter ) or a fry up after a night of heavy is drinking is quite literally the last thing can stomach . only thing that anchors me again is a cheese and onion sarnie from . , know people are thinking , `` hard is it to grill some cheese '' , but there 's just something about the touch . 's the perfect blend of different cheeses they use , the choice of toasted bread that holds it all together , the way it 's grilled it 's just bang on the money ! up the hangover , does n't leave you feeling even worse and tastes magical . they have loyalty cards here as well so if you eat as many grilled sandwiches as do , you 'll reap the rewards !",5.0
"of the reviews about the miss the point .

's not fancy inside and looks pretty basic but for total it was ideal . in we got large cups of tea and full breakfasts . what we needed ! definitely a side note the reason have n't given this stars is because there were waitresses working , one of which was more interested in her phone than providing any level of service . welcome , no eye contact and when we came to pay she summed up the value and held out her hand .",4.0

"of us had lunch today at de . food . had told the restaurant in advance - one veggie , one , one birthday . request continued to be a surprise throughout the meal . each course was served we had to check with staff / no wheat / no foie gras . asked for rye bread . said no gluten free bread . times gluten free bread was laid on the table . of us were given foie gras as an amuse buche . they were whipped away . veggie was often served well after the rest of us . we waited for all to be served our food then became cold . coffees - two mistakes - and one served so long after everyone else . number of staff - all male waiting staff . but chaotic . the standard one would expect at all . . wo n't last . n't go there again for a treat .",2.0
"time we went for lunch and it was so good . always the menu changes and on they have a set menu and so the only choice you get is which drinks you want to go with the meal . not to worry , the food is starters consisted of goats curd with honey comb on brioche ( ) , beef carpaccio on rye cracker ( ) and the fried chicken in buttermilk ( ) . mains consisted of pork belly with red cabbage and fennel ( ) , cauliflower & melted cheese with has browns ( ) and garlic bread ( ) . desserts consisted of apple crumble ( ) and lemon cheese cake and custard ( ) dish was so fresh , the tastes of all the ingredients were so distinctly noticeable , but complemented each other so well and the price is so so good by standards . paid ( all in for the two of us , including drinks and service ) . : we prefer to go on , because even though the market is closed there is still a nice buzz but quiet , which gives you a chance to wander around the area in peace , have a coffee at , for instance , and eat a great meal @ 's without feeling too crowded .",5.0

"ate here recently for the first time and was a little bit disappointed . pasta is all freshly made and looks delicious ; the staff were charming and the decor is quirky and welcoming . do agree with other reviewers that the pasta portions are on the small side for , but then again we did n't leave hungry . antipasti were tasty , but it 's hard to go wrong with getting some artichokes out of a jar and slicing some prosciutto . main complaint is that both the tagliatelle and the house speciality pasta were undercooked . before get accused of not understanding that pasta should be eaten al dente , they were not al dente . have lived in both and - the home , incidentally , of fresh filled pasta - and have eaten more than my fair share of homemade pasta . pasta here was a little on the thick side - thicker than have ever eaten in . bit the edge of a , the inside was n't actually cooked properly - it was still pale and textured like uncooked fresh pasta ( because it had n't had time to cook all the way through ) - so it was more of a crunch than a bite . sauces were delicious and authentic tasting . think it 's a bit cheeky to charge extra for , even if it is . tiramisù was very light and delicious ( not strictly a tiramisù as it does n't contain coffee , but that was a plus point for me ) .",3.0

family often go but had avoided it . by the reviews am not the only one to think this is awful . wanted meat and got rubbish . few almost inedible pieces of uncooked meat of the six small pieces made me so sick had to extract it from my mouth in a napkin . could not chew or swallow plate far too expensive for what it was . at least the bottle of beer although expensive was large . the small prawns and squid were not good although unusual . makes it even more of a rip off because service is so friendly and food so bad . am not the only one to think that . full of young girls chatting which is just about what it is good for . been to other but again like and many many others just shows how a chef even can give a place a name to draw people in and then watch it go to lot of water again with few bits floating in it .,1.0
"left thinking , how did just spend on that ? was for a single steak tartare starter with crisps ( yes crisps ! ) , a seafood stew and duck leg for mains , and icecream and a chocolate cake for deserts with a bottle of house red . the plus side , the food quality was good , but portions are undeniably small ( and 'm not a fatty ) . restaurant is both literally and figuratively cold , the former being achieved through a giant door that opens almost directly into the seating area , and the latter through an overuse of bleak wooden work surfaces and minimal furniture . not notice the staff issues that other reviewers have mentioned . sat at the bar and ate - a frizzy haired young waitress was bubbly and very attentive , though the same could n't be said for her stern faced manager , who did not seem to possess a sense of are certainly better places to go for the money .",3.0

"'ve been here a couple of times now and the service is never great but last week was ridiculous . food was so slow coming out ( we were in there for for lunch ) , when it finally did come out we were missing a meal which did not arrive until we had asked three separate members of staff followed by the manager and even then it did n't come out for about by which time everyone else on the table had finished eating . saw this happen to other tables in the restaurant too . had to ask for everything at least three times to get sauces , water etc . waiting staff didnt seem to have a clue what they were doing . did get offered some free prosecco as an apology which was appreciated but wo n't be going back !

"nice food , pizza and pasta good for a chain . drinks choice although some non alcoholic cocktails would be an improvement . generally good although the waiters did get very distracted by a pretty girl sitting on her own , they seemed to know her , maybe waiting to start her shift . , it was like bees around a honeypot and they had to away to get dessert etc . it made for a laugh .",4.0
is a perfect place with a traditional thai food . whole experience was just great . though it was busy we got our table very quickly . waiter was very good as well . recommended the duck breast with a sour tamarind sauce which was amazing and the thai calamari ! the best calamari ever had . definitely come back .,5.0
"been a few times now but went on my own last week . poached eggs and toast and it was brought to me exactly as 'd asked - no spinach , no dressing , just butter on the bread and a light sprinkling of salt .

'd chosen which ones to have on the basis of the descriptions from the server and they were spot on . small criticism would have been that the steak left the party quite early on , which was a shame , but there was a lamb dish and the fish dishes were great - the sea bream was pretty spectacular . could possibly be improved with the starters : the tuna carpaccio was a pretty unattractive heap and the crab scone was , well , a scone with crab meat in the middle ; a bit dry , if quite tasty . , overall , we enjoyed the meal , the service and the ambiance . wines were good , as well .",4.0
"when it arrived the fish stew looked very good and was dressed with fennel and fresh herbs , however the fish had a nasty taste and smell which tainted the entire dish and was unable to eat any of it . briefly stopped by to ask if everything was but did not give me time to answer her - was chewing a piece of before she was off again . finally managed to attract her attention she told me that she had already asked if everything was . was not charged for this main course , nor was offered an alternative or an apology which think would have been appropriate given the circumstances . husband 's meal of chicken was good and he enjoyed it .",2.0

"concept has been driven down by the fact that there is now one on almost every street corner . 's still popular though and the branch can get really busy some lunch times . it 's busy , 'd avoid this one because you ca n't hear a word of what people of saying due to the background noise ( it 's like school dinners ! ) and the waiting staff are liable to make mistakes ( it 's happened at least once on each of the last visits ) . if you 're in a hurry though , service is speedy .",3.0

"got a special deal for dinner here ( courses and a cocktail for on opentable ) . got to the with my friend and the restaurant is on the right side of the room , with a club area on the left . music was loud , we were screaming to each other across the table the whole night , it was really not a nice experience at all . the way , am not old ! in my ! food itself was perfectly good ( although slightly disappointed that there were so many add ons on the it was no where near only per person as the deal had stated ) . friend chose the steak and chips . were both served , however unfortunatley she didnt have any then the waiter forgot about us and so we waited for ages until the cutlery arrived and she could start her by then it was kind of cold . in all it was very loud , food was alright , waiters were rushed off their feet and all very hectic and and the manager ( 'm guessing thats who he was ) came to try and get us to stay and have dessert ( we didnt want any ) then he tried to get us to stay and have a drink at the bar ( we just had enough at this point ) . little too forceful for me . would not go back .",2.0
"stopped in for a bite of lunch on the way to oxford street for some shopping . arrived a few minutes before opening . seated everyone waiting in a very timely manner . ordered a roast chicken ceasar salad , garlic mushrooms and fish fingers with chips . was pleasantly surprised that the salad came with nearly half a chicken . garlic mushrooms were delightful and my partner said the rest of her meal was very tasty . thought it seemed overstuffed but it just created a busy atmosphere with quick service . we were in the centre of garden , it was good value , good service and good quality .",4.0

'm not the world 's biggest sourdough fan , so it 'd be nice if they offered different breads ( one or two choices would be fine ) , and this was my real issue , the just seemed to lack flavour . cheese was a bit , as were the beans and the tuna taste hardly made it through - very disappointing . think the real killer was that the cheese and tuna had very little salt , and just did n't convey their flavour above the me , the answer is n't adding condiments or salt afterwards , this is a melt , not a burger , it should be ready to eat . is n't exactly expensive , it does make 's wrap look like excellent value , which can be had just down the road of those things , but unfortunately , due to lack of flavour , find it hard to give it more than stars .",3.0

"booked for myself and my husband to see in the of . had researched a number of options but the location of the was second to none . was n't the cheapest night out but we knew what the prices were for other locations nearby and it seemed good value given location and what was on offer . evening surpassed our expectations by a considerable margin ! ! knew the location would be wonderful but the boat was decorated in a very classy way , there was loads of space between tables so you felt like you were having a very private meal ( had expected it to be packed to the rafters ! ) and the staff were attentive . entertainment throughout dinner ( a pianist and then a singer ) were also brilliant and a good warm up for later ! food was good - nice , well thought out blend of courses and good for a large event where everything was served together . was n't star food - but let 's be fair - you 're paying for location , not the gourmet event of a lifetime ! had also expected the alcohol prices to be exorbitant given that they had a captive audience . , we were more than pleasantly surprised - nothing eye watering and very sensible pricing that meant we felt we could really enjoy the drinks and have what we wanted rather than nurse them whilst waiting for our champers that was included at midnight ! view from the deck at midnight was simply spectacular . taking fireworks , directly in front of you . can not do it justice if you love , as we do ! girls even brought our fizz out to us in the pouring rain as we 'd left our table to head outside early ! midnight we danced until the early hours and then headed home after the initial ' had already passed through the tube . one of the best nights out of my life . are already priming ourselves to book for next year !",5.0

"'ve been to on four or five occasions now and have thoroughly enjoyed it every time . food is extremely tasty and love the fact that they are constantly adding new things to the menu while retaining old favourites . particular would strongly recommend the chicken rendang and the black cod but my favourite has to be the crab tempura starter ; it 's incredibly addictive . also do gorgeous cocktails , which slip down very easily ! service has been very welcoming every time 've been and find it great value for money . look forward to getting take out from the restaurant very soon",5.0
"on , location is great , as close to the theatre , and we chose to come here before the showing of decor was ordered our drinks and prawn crackers for starters . drinks came within a reasonable time frame , however , our prawn crackers never came . partner had to go up to the bar and request these , they were given to him to bring back to the table himself ! then proceeded to take our order , and we waited around mins for the food came and did not look appetizing what so ever . noodles we ordered were grey looking , and the sauces watery . took one bite of the noodles . cold . were the other dishes we mentioned this matter to the waitress who was extremely apologetic and took our food away and advised she would get this sorted for us straight minutes the food appeared on our table again , hot this time , but had obviously been heated in the microwave and . had sweet and sour chicken on which the batter had gone soggy from the again mentioned to the waitress that the food was n't up to scratch and that we would n't eat or pay for it . she was lovely and very to say we did n't have the greatest of experiences here , luckily we left enough time to grab a quick something else to eat before the show .",1.0

"was my first time at ` s and loved every bit of it . menu may seem small but there is quite a bit of selection . is great is that you can choose how hot you want your food to be , so it is quite convenient . still makes it feel like a fast food place is the fact that you have to go place your order on your own , a waiter does not come to you . sure to get the bottomless drink option , they had a great selection in the drink fountain , so it is definitely worth it . than that , just enjoy the food !",4.0

"had high hopes of this place especially as it is often given rave reviews by its customers . my experience was underwhelming . should have read the late review of the place which understand was not flattering whole ambience is of a bistro than an upmarket restaurant - although the the individually folded disposable cotton hand towels in the loos might suggest otherwise . arrived around , to be greeted on opening the door , by a cramped lobby and a steep staircase . left we entered the restaurant and were greeted by someone witht who had understanding to my my mind was not a good start to the evening . were promptly shown to our table which was located against the wall , where the seating space was very cramped . be fair all the tables seemed to be like this ] . seats themselves were basically old bistro style wooden chairs with no arms and were very uncomfortable . small table was also rickety and unstable . were white linen cloths but no flowers or candles . decor of the room itself was a watered down attempt at art , the only notable features being a couple of mirrors attached to some pillars and the dark coloured woodwork . was , but despite the pretty [ some might say tacky ] lights outside , inside the decor was definitely from the scrooge school of art , with the only minimalist decorative feature being a plastic garland which looked like it had been bought at a local store . were no pretty lights , no stars , no candles , no frosted grapes or fruit , no holly , no ivy , no flowers - nada - just one plastic garland draped over at the back of the room . assume this lack of festive decoration was either due to the fact the restaurant is always fully booked , so they feel there is need to bother , or because it regards itself an establishment primarily for the educated `` foodie '' who can be expected to have little interest such tacky things as decor or indeed the visual presentation of the restaurant more generally . perhaps be fair once the restaurant filled up it did n't lack atmosphere , this being provided by the noise and general hubbub of its clientele some of whom seemed to consist people who would like to live near but could not afford to or who perhaps did live in but were tired of their local restaurant choice , and had for the evening to see what a trip out to a starred restaurant bistro near would be like . by the the fact the restaurant was full on a evening they either had had a previously better experience than , or they were inclined to rely too heavily on the views of `` experts '' . service however was good : unpretentious , and swift the waiters seemed to glide effortlessly about the place despite the cramped nature of the establishment . only complaint was that found could not easily understand the accent of our softly spoken server . were presented with a very extensive [ if pricey ] wine list which am sure compares well with other establishments of this quality . as we were driving , only chose a small glass of merlot - this was pleasant but nothing special . partner had a glass of fresh orange juice . [ came with a lump ice despite him not asking for it ] menu here is in style and offers a table experience which was priced at per person [ rather more than expected from their website which suggested a lower price ] . matter , there was a fair choice of dishes and an extensive wine menu . both chose the same dishes am not sure why starter of fish cakes in a creamy chunky soup was well presented and was simply superb . first class . it was all down hill from there . our main course we chose a steak which came with with chunky chips [ this dish was extra per head ] . was , as would be expected for fillet streak and very tender was cooked carefully to our choice , and was well presented on the plate - but the flavour ? a completely different story . my mind it was bland and complete lacking in flavour , [ as was the accompanying jus ] . this was an off day but one wonders why a restaurant of this quality is offering this expensive cut of meat [ which to my mind does n't compare well the flavour of a good ribeye steak ] instead of less less expensive cuts which are known known to have a better flavour . perhaps suggests that the chef here needs to be more discriminating and place greater weight on the flavour of the meat and rather less on a the fancy name of this quite frankly over rated cut . was n't bad , but just was n't good value for money [ remember we paid extra } and it was lacking in flavour . accompanying chips were the saving grace , being both crisp and having an excellent flavour . the meat should have been the star and it was n't - it was just bland . desert was baked . consisted of a grapefruit sorbet covered in meringue accompanied by an assortment of fresh fruit salad . sorbet itself was well flavoured , if perhaps a little tart [ but then again grapefruit is ] , unfortunately it was ruined by the meringue which looked rather prissy being piped with tiny stars it had a curious elastic consistency and an odd and almost unpleasant taste which could n't exactly nail down - however more notably it lacked the requisite sweetness to offset the tart sorbet . for presentation , the dish looked like an individual lemon meringue pie might have bought at or the & frozen food counter . thought it a disappointment despite the elaborate description on the menu . not possessed a star , been somewhat less expensive and less cramped , i might have rated it as four stars the but given the lack of space and comfort , the rickety tables , the unspectacular food and the poor value for money could n't . [ bill came to over for two , even though we only had one small glass of merlot wine and single glass of orange juice and no coffee ] . was just expecting too much and was thus bound to be disappointed . based on my experience , one wonders if there is n't an element of `` '' about the reputation of this place . doubt will be patronising this establishment in the foreseeable future .",3.0
serves decent food and reasonable prices but lacks on atmosphere because of a lack of customers . ? can only think it 's because of it 's slightly out of the way location . you want a decent meal and good place to talk this is great though . match days at though as it 'll be packed then .,3.0

"went sat nov pre the killers at the for an early was great , the view is fantastic , overlooks tower bridge and the tower of london accross the thames dont really get a better city view than that anywhere ! you 'd expect to pay top tourist dollar here , but for a family of including a bottle of wine we paid approx for really good italian food courses ! . service was great and we will definately visit again when in london village ! food was great too !",5.0
"is an unusual restaurant . entered into a tiny reception area and were show past the long bar to our table , which felt somewhat squashed between the wall and the main walkway . decor is mostly black and white , the lighting quite low and the noise levels rather loud so did find it difficult communicating with our friends on the other side of the menu had a good mix of dishes - there is probably more fish than meat - but we all enjoyed what we chose . starters , whilst expensive , were delicious and more generous than many other restaurants . main courses were equally good in taste , but most come without additional potatoes or veg which you are encouraged to choose at vast cost . is a varied choice for dessert but best value seemed to be the plate - a taster selection of about five desserts for almost the same price as a single one . wine list was not as lengthy as might have expected for this type of establishment , but there were still some very expensive bottles on there . the food was good but the experience not as special as might have hoped .",4.0

arrived there was nobody at the front desk and we were ignored at the bar for about minutes despite there being available staff . service thereafter was good . were regularly blocked and at the start of the night there was no soap available . atmosphere was poor and the carpet and furnishings in poor condition . was average but not worth the money in my opinion - we had the set menu . would n't go back and would n't recommend to a member .,3.0
"read good reviews we were looking forward to experiencing the delights being offered . , our real experience was one of disappointment as we never got to taste the food ! waiting one and half hours we decided to leave the restaurant . was a complete lack of organisation and management , with no real attempt to engage with the customers . main priority was to serve the takeaway outlet . we received a drink and a we were ignored . will not be going back .",1.0

"can not be clear enough - this is a . are fast to get people seated , and from there on it 's downhill . waiter was quick to take our order . we waited sometime for the drinks to arrive . waited for ages for steak and fries . simply must not take such a long time for such a simple meal ! had a salad on the side . had been prepared several hours earlier , as both the dressing and the cucumbers and tomatoes were dried up . sauce had absolutely nothing to do with . ordered my steak medium rare , it was well done . girlfriend had a california chicken . ' on top , was not cheddar but some odd . be fair the waiter offered me to bring a new steak but declined due to did not want to wait in ages again for the kitchen to prepare it . he offered dessert og coffee again declined , as we just wanted to get out as quickly as possible . regret did n't tell the two girls who came in after us , after two women left the restaurant because of the waiting time , that hoped they were not too hungry and they should be patient . the other side from us an elder couple and their granddaughter also waited way too long . is simply not acceptable at those prices charged . finally can not recommend this place - find somewhere else !",1.0

"for lunch here today on a family day out in . a total disaster . of all the waitress brought the starters out with the main courses , she then got one of the main courses wrong and gave us a swordfish dish instead of the salmon salad ordered . us pointing to the menu , she seemed incapable of understanding what we wanted and came back twice to check , finally telling us that the kitchen did not have all the ingredients . ordered a chocolate ice cream for my nephew and she brought a vanilla ice cream in a warm sundae glass , when she finally came back with the right ice cream we had to ask for a spoon ! ladies toilets were absolutely filthy ! regular customers of this chain in our home town we were shocked at just how bad this place was .",1.0

coming here for a number of years and never experience the service or rather lack of service like last night . waiter just seemed to forget to bring things when we asked for them . we spent the night constantly repeating our request . food was great like usual but it just seemed that our waiter was just not interested . seems like everyone in the area that we were sitting was having the same issues . taking too long to come or not getting what you requested .,3.0

( ) was extremely rude ( fed up with it all assume , so hoping she 's not always like that ) when she asked me what expected my very heavily melted ice cream with chocolate mousse served on a warm plate to look like ! ! said something like the asking price of quid please . rip-off . miserable and arrogant with it . on , know you can do better than this , but not with staff who ca n't treat customers with respect .

", the food was excellent . there with the best . booked do n't remember being told only had the table for hrs and certainly was n't reminded on arrival . we took our time to choose our food , which then caused a rushed feeling throughout the meal with the main course being served too quickly after our starters . were asked to move at but decided to leave rather than move . service is good but this and the restaurant feels commercial . such as , and are significantly better experiences . was also disappointed with the wine menu . was n't on a budget but it runs through my earlier commercial reference when the majority of wine was more than , so finding a bottle for was difficult although possible . is little excuse not to have some wines in the eat out in often and there are many better experiences so wo n't be returning here .",3.0

"group of us met up here for lunch . is a moored boat right next to the rail bridge that crosses the into . we arrived the tide was out and the ramp down to the boat was very steep . had a drink in the bar as everyone arrived and then sat down to lunch . boat looks out on the and on the other side of the river , so the view is great . had pre-ordered off the for courses set menu and our food started to arrive shortly afterwards . of the food was very good and the staff looked after us . of us found the slight rocking of the boat when another boat passed by as a little off putting , but more when you are standing than sitting . was definitely better than was expecting , particularly the food . finishing we were asked to return to the bar and later , probably we were asked to go down to the lower bar . which point , we opted to head somewhere else for more drinks .",4.0
"were so excited to find a restaurant in on our way to the theater . son had eaten at his restaurant in which he enjoyed tremendously . were guided down into a cavern - which was interesting - and seated near a speaker playing very loud music . asked if the music could be turned down so we could speak without shouting at each other . were told the music could not be turned down as it would affect the whole restaurant . , the menu is limited to get folks in and out quickly . son ordered the pizza . did not fit the description . it was inedible - yellow onions sliced on top of a pizza crust with a bit of cheese and three tiny slices of banger . ordered the fish and chips . , the fish was delicious but as dug under the fish to the chips , the chips were cold and not cooked . we could finally get the waiter 's attention ( no easy task - more comments later ) , he admitted that the chef knew they had not be properly cooked . would a restaurant of this caliber purposely serve bad food ? meal was credited but did not go to the restaurant for a free meal . went because was excited to have a delicious , simple daughter ordered the rare beef salad . was the only one satisfied with her service was terrible . staff looked down and away from our glance to avoid being asked to serve us . waiter never checked in on how we were doing and basically avoided us as well . we were left with the impression that the restaurant is a draw to tourists and does n't care about long term reputation as there is always a flow of tourists going through . my son had not had such a good experience in , might never go to another restaurant . , then again , might be wary in view of this terrible experience and disgusting food .",1.0

husband daughter and went for a celebration meal . were greeted warmly and seated upstairs . music was loud and we all found it difficult to read the menu as it was so dark . couple at the next table was using the candle to see the menu . were shown some great pieces of raw meat and the waitress explained the different types of steak and how they should be cooked . due to noise it was difficult to hear her . ordered and were given the wrong starter which we returned . our starter came it was fresh and very tasty . daughter and had ordered chateaubriand and it was served as a lump of meat on one plate despite being for two people . asked for it to be sliced into two portions and when we tried the side dishes they were cold . complained and the food was quickly replaced . food was delicious and the manager offered us desserts on the house to compensate . it too much to ask that when you go out to a restaurant ( not cheap ) for a meal that you want and are willing to pay for decent food served warm in ambient surroundings . the situation was remedied but we would rather the situation had not arisen in the first place to spoil the occasion .,3.0

'm disappointed that the management thinks it necessary to charge for side dishes . adds for side dishes or extra to the bill if you 're paying for meal , including service and two half bottles of wine , plus an extra glass of wine and two coffees came to ( no desserts ) . think that 's just too expensive in what is basically a decent quality but straight local restaurant ; it 's just too much money to go there on a regular basis . to give some sort of comparison , dined the previous day ( party of four also ) at , 's one star in . had the set lunch ( choice of items per course ) , all three courses plus bottle of decent house wine and three glasses of prosecco for exactly the same price , .",3.0

'm not sure would come back although the waiters were good to us all this time , but definitely sure wo n't come back for the food .

"went on a blue and felt rather blue by the time we left also . the blue dishes were just each but the same ones just kept going around and around again pretty much for the whole of our visit . of the food tasted okay but one of the dishes chose was stone cold when it was supposed to be hot - obviously because it had been going around and around and around again all over again ! partner asked them to cook one of the dishes fresh as it was also cold and he caught the `` chef '' trying to reheat instead . disgraceful . , the cooking bit in the middle was dirty with unwashed pans and flour everywhere etc . wo n't be going back which is such a shame as apparently it used to be good once",2.0

"used to work just around the corner from and was a frequent visitor . in on holiday , we knew it would be a great place to meet up with long-lost friends , some of whom had never been to a restaurant before . enjoyed picking at the olives and salad veg while we decided what to eat . always think with a group it is great to eschew the mains and just get a whole pile of the starter dishes so that everyone gets to try everything . had , ( smoked aubergine dip ) , ( spicy nuts ) , ( they are excellent ) , ( salad with crispy pita bits ) , tabbouleh ( salad ) , batata harra ( spicy potatoes ) and ( spinach pastries ) - all of which were excellent and washed down with a red wine . the we ordered cheese pastries ( borak ) and spicy ( ) . are starters to choose from so its unlikely you 're not going to find something you like . the food was delicious and accompanied by two types of lebanese bread . remembered from previous vists as patchy but we had absolutely no complaints about the friendliness and attentiveness of our waiters . my favourite , even though now live in !",5.0

"arrived at at , late , worried about not fitting into the schedule of our reservation ( slot for dinner ) service has been from the start . arrived , the waiter simply showed us our table in the corner , but did n't move from the reception to bring us manager came to take the orders soon after we received the menus , giving us no time to go through all the dishes . asked for a couple of minutes more , and it turned out to be a minutes waiting . finally managed to order a drink and the food . we received our starters , they realized we had n't get the , so they brought it to our table while we were already were very good in both flavour and presentation . octopus was soft and tender , and the potato cream was not overloaded with butter , so you could really taste all the flavour of the potatoes . beef loin was perfectly cooked and the aji sauce helped to the flavour of the meat . , the service was . had to wait minutes to have our table clean and to receive our main courses . ( that time , it was already , that was the time our reservation was supposed to be over ) . courses were spot presentation was great , and the flavours were perfectly balanced . you can expect from a fine dining that we had to wait a long time before the waiter removed the plates from our table ( but not the empty bottle of wine ) . must mension that tables are extremely small and very close one to the other , so you really need to remove everything you do n't need to save space . finished our dinner with the desserts . to the previous dishes , desserts were a little disappointing , though as nicely presented . amazonian chocolate cream was extremely heavy and thick . chirimoya parfait did n't have the soft texture expected , it was way too hard and thick , more like a thawed pannacotta . ice cream was beautiful in presentation , but the was very buttery and not refreshing at all . tasted more like a cold curd then like a proper ice the desserts , nobody came to our table for minutes even if the floor was n't busy at all . finally managed to catch the attention of a waiter and asked for the bill . discovered that our dinner cost over pounds , including a discretionary % service charge ( around pounds ) , which was n't absolutely fair for the service we received . left the resturant without even a goodbye by the floor if the food was great , the experience was lacking of quality in all the other aspects . 've been working in hospitality ( fine dining restaurants ) for over years , and this is not what you can expect from a michelin starred restaurant .",2.0

"stumbled upon this restaurant while making our way back to our hotel from the . was a evening and we had already been turned away from a few restaurants for lack of reservations or long wait . we entered the restaurant it was also crowded and we thought we would be turned away again . , the host was able to arrange a table for us in their downstairs dining area after a short wait . spite of a very busy dining period , service was prompt , professional and pleasant . menu offers a wide variety of dishes that should satisfy the most discriminating tastes . going into too much detail , all of our meals and were delicious , properly prepared and the portions were satisfying . menu prices are reasonable and fair . would highly recommend this restaurant but recommend reservations if you plan to dine there on a busy evening .",5.0

"can say . an amazing find . did n't know this place existed , but came across it by accident in ! is a restaurant in the middle of with all the action going on around you . and at their best . retro decor is fun , the food amazing and the service fantastic . can watch your food being prepared and feel the warmth from the stone ovens . fish and chips ( catch of the day ) and chicken with spring greens are well worth the visit alone , add to that the gateaux and the marathon ice cream and homemade lemonade or pink coke and you have a fantastic meal . tea is available too ! out of every time ! !",5.0
"place is ok , food is really good and the guys were friendly . only thing that puts me off this place is how pushy they are to sell as much as possible . times was asked whether was sure if did n't want another drink . waiter also suggested to order more food as the plates were small tapas , although found it was enough for a quick lunch . asked for the bill , they made sure we were n't up for a little dessert or coffee . guys , making your customers feel like they 're not buying enough looks greedy and will put off people from coming back . of how good and local your food is . go for lunch to market every day as work nearby . doubt i 'll be coming back to as hate feeling like a cheap customer .",3.0

"a trip to a concert close by , we wanted a snack en route home and dived in as the kitchen was closing just before . was evident in the snacks we ordered that they were prepared hurriedly as they were not really hot enough and had been taken out of the pan just a minute or so too soon . do think that if you say yes , we can serve you but you need to order quickly should mean that you will still get the standard as usual rather than a half hearted attempt by a chef running out of the kitchen . understand that he wants to do that at that time but if you ca n't quite get it right , refuse the custom and do n't take the money - or say , choose something cold as the has been turned off . that aspect , the seasoning of the warm crab arancini and the parmesan potato croquette was lacking . and fennel meatballs bouncy but tasty . service .",3.0

's a lot good to say about this place , it has a good vibe , nicely laid out , perfectly located for tourists without being a tourist trap . my visit they need to improve the service quality quite significantly though and get back to the basics when it comes to food & definitely worth a drop in , especially if you can get the & deal .",3.0

for a quick and unsophisticated meal at a very good price . advantage of the meal deal of two courses for just over and thoroughly enjoyed quality of the food and service is inconsistent and depends greatly on how busy they are . said that if you are unsatisfied tell the staff and they will endeavour to sort out the issues quickly .,3.0
"went to restaurant to celebrate a friends birthday . were all very excited . beforehand were pricey , unashamedly over iced but delightful . into the restaurant the smells are just incredible . went a la carte , and after an unexpected amusing little bite of gram cake , each one of the starters served were stunning . had the chickpea starter but would happily of had any one of the four at our table ( which tasted ) all superb . wines also were continued along the same line , had the lamb cutlets and every mouthful . also ordered some sides of aromatic rice , dhal , chickpeas and naan breads , all excellently prepared . only critique of the main is chewed whole cardamom pods during my meal , one of which swallowed , ! feel at this level of cooking this should n't happen . be warned the tandoori chicken is half a chicken ! with a generous salad garnish , this could be better conceived was the chocolate option and would give it out of and that for presentation alone . balance , dark chocolate domes filled with chocolate mouse , a sugar thingy and the waiter dramatically poured a jug of warm chocolate sauce over the lot to which nearly screamed ! the only relief from this sickly sugar overdose was cherries and a teaspoon of yogurt ice cream . waded to get even half way through it and wish never tasted or ordered it . wife 's dessert looked a whole lot better . think it was raspberry and hibiscus if recall . think sadly the whole dessert menu was not of the same standard as the rest of the meal , much like most curry houses across the country . would have loved to have seen small petit four size sweets selection to have with coffee . think of desserts and the flavours would hope for , think coconut , cinnamon ice cream pistachio nuts , saffron , mango , even a cardamom infused brûlée would have been a delight ! easy on the chocolate please ! in all this was a stunning experience and hope will visit again sometime . wish all at continued success , they deserve it .",5.0

"visited this style restaurant with my family , am very familiar with turkish food and instead of making the journey to north london thought would try this local restaurant some meze , started with an aubergine style starter , which was tasty but not out of this world , some and humus , and overall was quite to nip to the toilet and to be honest wished i had waited as it stank , this always concerns me as how difficult is it to maintain a clean toilet and this didnt exactly fire up the chose a mixed grill , with a mixture of kofte , beyti , shish etc , not bad meat but the salad accompanying it was dull , when you compare this to the likes of mangal etc where the salad is bursting full of herbs and flavour you realise this isnt really that in all not bad , but wont visit again .",3.0

"and bland fish and chips that in no way compare to other local establishments . would give the restaurant an average , but it 's hard to justify for just okay fish . the price is this high due to the bottomless chips but are bottomless chips really necessary ? beer selection and boring interior . smelled like fried fish when left . was fine and the food arrived in a reasonable timeframe . , there are just too many better options out there . or the .",2.0

"sea shell has a reputation for being the best fish and chip shop in , it isnt . almost certainly is most expensive fish and chip shop in . , although by no means the best chip shop in , it is better than so many . quality fish and chips are truly disgusting and some of what is on sale in is nasty , so if you are visiting , would recommend it as its easy to get to from the city centre . be ready to pay a lot ( for a takeaway and for a meal in the restaurant ) .",3.0

"went with another couple on a evening and what can say , the food and whole experience was amazing . had n't booked the tasting menu in advance , but they were happy to accommodate our late request and we are so glad they did . the tasting menu was real value for money and allowed us to sample the highlights from the main menu . simply could not fault the food , my husbands favourite was the duck liver mousse , mine had to be the marshmallow wagon wheel ! friends most enjoyed the smoked salmon and the soufflé ! really was a generous tasting menu and definitely do n't recommend a big lunch before hand if you want to complete the courses ! ! ! ca n't wait to return , definitely the most exciting , tasty and value for money food around .",5.0

"really wanted to love because read regularly but the portions were pretty small and the food itself was bland . whole experience felt like eating healthy food years ago when the best mainstream healthy options you could hope for was , spelt crackers and a low fat ready meal . was dry , tasteless and felt like punishment . the desserts we ordered were seriously deficient in sweetness : 've made some of these recipes at home myself to the letter and mine turned out better than the ones in her deli , natural sugar should n't equate to savoury . were also texture issues with the desserts , another old fashioned health food problem . really do n't think that needs to be the case anymore when there are healthy sweet options that are now available at supermarkets and outlets like that do not feel gritty or strange . disappointed friend and ended up going walking to cafe instead , where we had a great dinner . quality of ingredients being used and how they are sourced should never override the reason why people leave their houses and pay for someone to make food for them instead of making it themselves : the food still needs to be good , and at the very least at the same level of what you are capable of making yourself at home . are several places that achieve this without compromising on taste ( e.g . : and ) in order to compete with these places think needs to seriously up their game in the area that counts the most . the staff were very friendly ( they seemed like they were still learning the ropes but they were trying ) and the decor is lovely wo n't be returning because of the food itself which is actually what would have assumed from 's blog and books would be the least of this cafe 's problems .",1.0

"'ve had spent days in and 's was the worst restaurant ever . walked in and waited till spoted us . was very irritating as looked at us and then continued what she was doing , another worker ( very nervous ) ignored us and third person eventually came and told us that they do n't know how long we have to wait . half of the restaurant was prepared for the a big party though there were free tables . asked why we ca n't take that one and they looked at me strangely not knowing what to say . after minutes of waiting for them to find us a table ( one of that was free ! ) nobody bothered to come for another minutes to take an order even though they looked at us few times and were looking like they didn ; t know if to come or not ? ? ? were getting hungry . guys sitting next to us started getting ready to leave and said to us luck ! ' . asked what they meant and they said they had waited for minutes at the table but nobody bothered coming to take an order and thought we would be more lucky ! that comment we decided to leave as nobody was intending to serve us . staff looked at us with no emotions as if the view of the customers leaving without placing an order is just a usual thing .",1.0

"food was decent ( had salmon teriyaki udon ) and the service was good but one begins to get the sense that there are too many restaurants like this one around . all honesty , the food was really not that different or unique compared with what one might find in thousands of other similar places around the world . is a trend that has passed its prime , in my opinion .",3.0

"spent almost ( two of us ) for dinner . left hungry and disappointed .

's got the feel of a place that 's running without an actually manager - just people who 've worked there for a while . 's all a bit sloppy . can see messy boxes under the seating where they 're storing things . when staff came out to eat their dinner ( why ca n't they eat before or after service ) they came out and sat at a table in the restaurant . 've seen that in cafes - fine , but in a restaurant ? of them came and sat at a table that 'd just been vacated by guests and she did n't bother clearing the table first . sat in among their mess and ate her meal . . food is bland . you 're a reasonably talented cook you can do it all at home much better . know , know , that 's not the point . it 's all a bit austere , worthy , frugal . do n't get the impression they 're passionate about their food . tempura was like an strange , and it did n't have that great fresh clean taste you 're used to from chefs . could taste the oil . vegetable dishes that came with our meal were tiny and looked embarrassed frankly , served in their bento box . had the set . rolls tasted like the veggie sushi you 'd get from . lack filling . so little filling you need a really light wrapper . the big sheet they 'd used , and rolled to make it , ended up being all you could taste . the steamed one was beyond tofu was good but really , but in a restaurant when is n't it . partner 's face was a picture when they put the cold udon noodles in front of him and he realised that was all he was getting as actual sustenance . it 's a big disappointment . 're much better off finding a decent restaurant and working out what you can eat from their menu . 'd rather sit in a nicer restaurant and eat plain sushi rice dipped into soy with a bit of - and order some tempura and some seaweed salad . would n't go again . you do go 'd suggest ordering a tiny amount - if you like it go ahead and order more . not , pay up and leave .",3.0

"was my first time eating at ; have heard many good things about so had high expectations , but must say was not overly impressed ! ordered a lunchtime beef bento box for only and when it arrived it looked very impressive , but was soon disappointed and regretting my decision to eat at ! bento box consisted of two salmon rolls , two chicken gyoza , some beef sirloin ' , and some very over cooked , very tasteless rice which just fell through my chopsticks and quite frankly ruined the rest of the meal ! am not normally one to complain , but this rice was so badly cooked that felt that someone must have made a mistake when cooking it and needed to say something . tried to explain to the waiter that the rice was very over cooked , but he just brushed it off saying that it is ment to be fluffy . explained that know how jasmine rice should be as have been cooking it at home for over years , and this was not it ! explained that it should be light and slightly ' together , not be swollen and each grain be completely separated from each other ! told me this was not ' rice ! explained that knew that , as sticky rice is completely different in that it ' together and is cooked in a very different way to ordinary jasmine rice , and repeated that normal jasmine rice when cooked properly should be light and slightly ' together ! ! ! explained that someone has used too much water when cooking this and that thought that they might appreciate being told of this ! waiter went on to tell me how they use rice steamers so it was not possible to have made a mistake etc etc etc ! this point stopped caring , gave up trying to be helpful , and made a mental note never to eat there again ! frankly , can cook much better food at home ! paid and left , never to return ! you want good food in , suggest you try either restaurant or restaurant , who both offer excellent food , not the average attempt at food that is on offer at !",3.0

( see pic ) was a good portion but quite dry with my dining partner using the sauces on the table to give a moist finish to the dish otherwise unable to eat it . was revolting ( see pic ) , made with curry paste and powder instead of paste and spices . actually had to argue this point with the dumb chef who made it because he thought typical curry powder was what went into a ! ! do n't understand , is n't the manager making sure the chefs get the food flavours right , especially as is made in advance so a tasting can be done prior to opening doors that day .

"discovered the restaurant whilst was having an afternoon tea at . in , near in . was a number of diners whilst we were in the venue which shows a good sign . chose the piece selection known as the which involves a selection of seasonal dishes . menu is seasonal so depending on when you visit , the dishes is likely to vary . bento box involves a variety of cooked beef dishes , served with barley and edamame rice and a soup of kombo dashi , cabbage , sesame , chives , corn and onion . looks very simple and the taste is lighten than the typical soup you get . also ordered the , which included breaded beef fillet , served on a bed of barley and edamame rice . is accompanied by nori , spring onion and fresh wasabi along with beef stock for making . is also served with the dashi soup . the dishes looked very small in portion size , it is filling . was recommended by the staff to enjoy the lighter dishes such as the tofu and sashimi before the beef dishes as it is more heavier and we would be too full to finish should it went the other way . with tasted very simple , the egg omelette with a piece of roe on top wasn ’ t anything spectacular to begin with . was followed by the in home-made tartar sauce with kumquat which introduced some flavour to my taste buds . marinated in wasabi and soy sauce was a little heavy , haven ’ t been much of a fried salmon fan for some time but it was slightly saltier than expected . having some of the and cleansed my taste pallet slightly before moving onto the with and . was a tasty dish and it certainly tasted fresh ( have had the unfortunate of tasting ‘ ’ fish before so have been more cautious about it ever since ) . same goes for the and , both were fresh and delicate in taste . with rosemary and white onion in sauce started to taste a little heavy and this was the dish . couldn ’ t taste the rosemary as much as had anticipated , however the was tasty and the texture was just right . in sauce and garnished in chive reminded me a little of ‘ ’ in many venues . dish was very pleasant and delicious as a break before the next three dishes . with vegetables and roll was a very complex tasting dish . roll was covered in hints of tempura batter whilst the vegetables inside kept it ’ s sweetness at the same dish consisted of beef with chilli and spring onion . can ’ t see much of the heavily marbled pattern on the beef unfortunately , however do enjoy the use of chilli and spring onion . last dish was the beef with chives and yuzu zest garnish . was tasty but heavy . appreciate a good beef but due to the previous dishes , started to feel very full . use of yuzu zest brings my appetite back and enjoyed the dish very much but you must appreciate the fact that there was a bowl of barley and edamame rice and a kombo dashi soup to go along the bento box . was also served with the same barley and edamame rice and the kombo dashi soup . does look simpler and also very bland , however the beef fillet was breaded and then fried . tasted better than the other ‘ katsu ’ dishes you have in other venues and this is not the reason because it was beef , in fact it is because the fillet was breaded generously and equally , and did not find a part where it tasted ‘ ’ and a part where it was ‘ heavily breaded ’ were served by a waiter – he did appear to be more like a manager , was very passionate with the dishes and our dining experience . explained dishes and introduction made us felt very welcomes . only dined at for lunch , therefore will suggest a dinner reservation to experience more of the beef selection .",5.0

"time to for an anniversary dinner tuned out to be a real disappointment . arrived at on night for an reservation . table was n't ready so they invited us to the bar downstairs for a drink . problem - we were n't in a hurry , but unfortunately this set the tone for the rest of the evening . was only one bartender serving at least other customers , which meant we waited for minutes and did n't get our drinks before we were escorted back upstairs to our table . drinks followed about minutes later . the service from the wait staff at our table was friendly and attentive , but there must have been delays in the kitchen and things went downhill from there . the first few plates , the others took longer and longer to materialise and we waited over minutes for our last plate , the wagyu ribeye . this time we sat with empty wine glasses . server seemed to disappear and no one else bothered to notice that we were lacking food or drinks for a considerable time . the ribeye finally did arrive our server simply said sorry as she put it on the table and then vanished before we could even ask to order anything else . did n't want to bother with dessert at this point , but we thought we might press our luck with tea and a whiskey . this proved difficult . tea order was taken , but when asked for the whiskey menu our server had to go find it and the tea arrived before she returned . took another minutes for the whiskey to arrive despite the bar being only a few feet away . , when it did come our server placed it on the table with her usual speedy move to turn around before we could ask for the bill or anything else . had to flag down a manager to ask for the bill , which took another minutes to arrive at which point asked for the service charge to be removed . did not surprise anyone and no one cared to ask about our problems with the service . were there for over and a half hours and probably had food on the table for about minutes or less . food we did eat was enjoyable , but not good enough to warrant returning to suffer this experience again . is the first time have asked not to pay a service charge in over years and it could have easily been avoided . gather the kitchen was running slow , but if they had simply checked on us occasionally it would have made things bearable . guess since we were only people , they were devoting efforts to larger groups , but as far as could tell , the restaurant was n't even at capacity . were several large empty tables throughout the evening . ca n't imagine how bad it would have been if the place was full . would recommend avoiding this restaurant at weekends or any other peak times until they manage to get their service in order .",1.0

visited this restaurant as a party of four on a week day place had just opened and we were one of the first parties to be food was quite nice but all the chicken dishes were made of thigh meat which must admit don ’ t like much prefer the breast . meant that for me the chicken sate and the were not to my had the beef as it was one of the few dishes that did not contain was quite nice but not much is a chain of restaurants and as such suffers from bulk pre preparation of quite simple inexpensive ingredients served up in a tasteless way and sold at a high don ’ t serve normal tea or earl grey or indeed any type of coffee only weird herbal teas and expensive flavoured in all if you like dark chicken meat and strange scented drinks this is the place for you .,3.0

"of us attended on at pm . on-line booking system was efficient and received a confirmation call the day before repeating my order back word for word , the only tea booking system that has done this so far , great . a party of ladies with little directional sense this really is a great location ( ca n't really miss the ! ) was a little anxious about the sea sensation as do n't like boats , it is noticeable but only a little . decor is lovely , it 's not uber posh or anything but it does look like a decent restaurant . am vegetarian and had separate sandwiches which like . food was fine , nothing amazing or anything and the desserts where a bit cheap tasting but my mum , auntie and friend all enjoyed it . was lovely to watch the eye as it gradually got dark , pretty . it is a pretty good price ( the service charge though is a bit steep as they do n't do too much ! ! ! ) would make this experience `` more afternoon tea like '' is if there is an explanation to what you are eating ( this is always done at posh places ) and having a tea menu and a wider variety of teas would be great too is a bit different to your normal tea location wise so for the price think worth a visit",4.0

the family here for lunch . place as packed as usual ( lots of customers ) but they managed to fit us in . sushi and sashimi was fantastic ; as was the tempura and soups . sushi is particular good ! ! ! kids loved the food as well . the opening times though as it 's not open at the weekend and only certain hours during the week .

"branch , firstly beer served in a small can and cost over ! had the chilli burger , like spicy food but the chilli was so hot it killed the whole burger . partner had a cheese burger , which was at chips were dry and hard with many of them stuck together , would guess they had been cooked then or just badly whole thing was just poor .",2.0

booked this restuarant for my wife and i for a lovely early evening meal on the back of some of the revues on here and i can honestly say i have never encountered such overpriced and underwhelming food as i did on saturday my wife ordered the free range turkey with all the trimmings only to discover that it came with no veg i ordered the day aged rib eye which although cooked to my likeing was accompanied with the smallest field mushroom and cherry toms no bigger than a pence piece and absolutely no seasoning used at all add bottle of water and a diet coke for a total of pound i feel completly ripped off needless to say i wont be going back,2.0
"decided to try as a friend of mine told me it was good but we had an awful soon as we got in the restaurant the waitress told me she booked a table for and not for as requested and after telling her this was her mistake not mine she started getting really pissed off and she did not give me any solution to the problem . asked her if we had to leave and find another place to eat but in the end she found a table for us . the end thought it would have been better to eat somewhere else . service is really bad : they brought us the wrong wine , they looked very unexperienced and they were not taking care of us at food is too expensive for what it is , ordered a chicken salad : leaves and pieces of chicken for . it a joke ? ? ? meat looked like a chewingum and nobody liked really bad experience .",1.0
", however not disability friendly very steep ramp down to the boat and either up or down stairs . drinks on the deck which was lovely the view of the river and the eye people watching on the bridge . food was basic steak without any salad , the risotto looked like a plate of vomit and was so salty unable to eat it , refused to pay and this was accepted without fuss , replacement offered but didnt have time as going on the have drinks here but not dine .",1.0
"had dinner here on the april , it was through so it was a fraction of the original price , we were able to choose from the a la carte menu course plus breads at the beginning then cheese and biscuits then coffee . also had a cocktail to begin with included in this was fantastic the best we have had for a long time could not fault it at all . would go again even if we had to pay the full price , certainly worth a visit and if you can get it through or similar go for it .",5.0

"had dinner there on a , the restaurant was quite empty . restaurant is actually outdoor so it was quite cold whilst we were having dinner . they could warm up the seats by heaters so that really a big problem . ordered several dishes and the one was really impressed with was the garlic mushroom . have to say am disappointed by the rest of the meal . food gets cold very quickly so it did not taste as nice as it can be . most ridiculous thing was the winter vegetables we ordered : literally a stick of carrot and parsnip and some other unknown veg and it cost us like for that .",3.0
"husband and walked about hours ( because we are blind and walked right past ) to get to the from after reading about it online on a recent trip to , and it did not disappoint . atmosphere was very trendy and it was very busy on a night . sat in the bar area on the first floor , has a very relaxed feeling . ordered cheese trays for two to start , ordered the fish and chips , and my husband ordered a burger . was so excited to get a chance to have some traditional fare during my trip as most places do not offer gluten free options on the classics , and it has been a long time since have been able to have fish and chips at cheeses arrived , with a separate board for each of us and included four cheeses , gluten free toast , and fig compote . cheeses are all cheeses . were excellent , and the fig compote was delicious paired with them . mains took a bit longer than expected , but the wait staff took note of this and came to the table to inform us the manager was looking into the delay without us even having to ask about it . food appeared within five minutes of that and was completely worth the wait . gluten free fish was wonderful in flavour and texture , and am picky about my fish as an east coast girl . homemade tartar sauce was lovely and the chunky chips were crisp without being overcooked . only complaint would be that the fish is served on a green pea puree , which , while tasty , made the crispy batter on the fish somewhat soggy ( but maybe this is how fish and chips with mushy peas is supposed to be served ? ) . would have preferred the peas on the side . husband enjoyed the burger as well , and he also really liked the chunky , would highly recommend this place , especially if you have gluten issues . my next trip to , look forward to trying the restaurant level upstairs !",5.0

"is a really nice pub with quite comfortable , but low chairs and tables . went on a to try the burgers , because living on a budget , burger deals are the best . burgers come in sourdough buns , which look absolutely amazing and more importantly , are quite tasty too . tried the beef and chicken burger and they were both great , but the chips do need some improvement . are quite big and a bit too soft to my liking . great thing about this pub is that they have a beer , , and the correct beer glasses for it . , 've heard that the quiz night on 's is very good too , so may have to try this later .",4.0

'd told him how we 'd booked from and he told us they did n't have a booking for us recorded anyhow ( so not sure what the fuss was about us being late for a non existent booking ! ) . said he never uses the internet so not sure who responded to our booking and then told us it would have been best to call to make the booking ( from ! ) . brushed all this aside because we were just looking forward to a good feed which is what we got ! pies were fabulous , the chips were too and the gravy was everything we 'd read about . to that a generous serving of veg and we ca n't complain about the food at all . the overall experience was ruined when the other late patron arrived , was thoroughly ( and loudly ) told off and then forced to apologise to the owner ! . every opportunity the owner reminded him that he was late and was a complete inconvenience . a staff member showed up and he was told off very loudly in front of us including hearing how his pay would be docked . really made us feel uncomfortable overall and ruined the atmosphere . think was having a particularly bad night and while he was pleasant to us we could n't wait to get out of food was excellent but the place had zero charm !

"went there for our anniversary but it was n't as romantic as the other branches , we were ushered into a tiny table in an corner , place was really busy and felt really claustrophobic . need to get rid of some of the tables as the over crowding look does n't look appealing , it also means you can never get the waiter 's attention , whether its because the waiter is blindsided himself with so many people or probably pretends he ca n't see you because it 's physically demanding to cross over to your table . was good but nothing special considering the price and the waiting time. #",3.0

"my partner went with friends on the opening week , she recommended that we go one evening to unwind after work . atmosphere was wonderful , and the service was excellent . was explained to us , from the concept of the food , to the tailored cocktails and the ethos behind the style of the restaurant . food was exemplary ; the yogurt puri were a delight - so much so we ordered another helping , and the puffed rice was inviting , fresh , and with the perfect mix of flavour and heat . a stand out was the chilli paneer , and the kati roll ; both of which would happily eat again , and attempted to steal from my partner 's plate ! of note were the selection of drinks ( though being a school night , we stuck to and shared a cocktail ) - the fact that the cocktail was clearly made with an on the spot sugar water mix , rather than a pre-made glucose `` simply syrup '' speaks volumes ; they care deeply about the food , the drink , and the experience , and seem to want to serve the food that you 'd want to make for yourself - there 's no . one of the best meals 've eaten this year , and we 're taking friends from out of town tonight for another round !",5.0

"were surprised at how quickly the food came out , not even minutes and how big the portions were . prawn dumplings were very good and meaty . originally chose beef ho fun but wanted chicken instead as my stomach can not handle beef but was informed it was not possible which maybe an indicator to how fresh the food is and explains the fast cooking time . then chose singapore noodles , the only downside to my noodle dish was that all the meat , veg etc had failed to be mixed together so presentation was poor but it still tasted very nice especially the fish cake . service is prompt and no waiting ages for someone to take your order price was n't that bad either but we had chosen dishes that were selected % off .",3.0
